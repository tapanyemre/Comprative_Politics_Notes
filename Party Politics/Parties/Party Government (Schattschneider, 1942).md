# Long Summary




**[Schattschneider. 1942. Party government.]{.mark}**

**Chapter 3**

He distinguishes between three types of political organizations.

1.  Political party (major party)

2.  Pressure group

3.  Minor party

Parties should be defined only in terms of bid for power (not motives
for which men want power) .

Party may be defined in terms of purpose and in terms of method used to
attain its purpose

[Purpose:]{.underline}

1.  Political party - Aims at control of the government as a whole.

> So, it has to be in control of the government or able to create and
> maintain a widespread expectation that it will take over the
> government soon.

2.  Pressure group

(he does not define them but says that they do not seek control of the
whole government)

3.  Minor party

Aims to have a determinative effect on power

[Method:]{.underline}

Peaceable method (no coup d'Ã©tat). Act within the framework of the
regime.

Precondition: Parties and government tolerate each other. Fare
competition

**A study in dispersion and concentration of votes**

Distinguishing method of party politics: *Maneuver with numbers carried
out in connection with voting in some numerous body having the power to
govern.*

Governing body: (1) has power to govern, (2) rights and positions are
well established (3) finds necessary to act by voting, preferably by
majority or a plurality vote.

Then he talks about dynamic in governing body (like parliament)

Let's say we have 300 members. Each has I 300^th^ of total power. But
when they have simple majority rule. 151 members has all the power while
149 none of the power.

It is this majority rule what invites party organization.

Further he argues that whole membership in governing body can be devided
into two classes:

1.  Few members who participate in conspiracy (consulted in advance
    about their position)

2.  Mojortiy who doesn't

If you have plurality rule so minimum number of people who need to
participate in conspiracy is two.

**The Caucus**

Even small conspiracy apt to produce some effect. What is the number
that need to participate in cuacus in order to gain contol of governing
body depends on the distribution of the votes among members who are not
in conspiracy. The higher the dispersion the lower minumum number of
mamber in conspiracy (caucus) needed.

He examine the example where 300 mambers need to elect 7 different
members for committee (out of more than 7 candidates). Each member casts
7 votes for each one of the candidates that they prefer. 7 memebrs with
the highest vote will be elected. 1 sixth of the members could determine
the outcome (if they agreed in advance about all 7 members that they
prefer) provided that other 250 did not consult (conspire) at all. 360

Assume that 1750 votes of those 250 members distributed as follows:

+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| | The table present only 1250 bcause usually some  |
| | share of the votes can be even more scattered    |
|  | which mean they are basically wasted. In         |
|  | addtition we should not expect members of cuacus |
|  | to vote for complete outsiders they usually vote |
|                   | for sombody who whould also receive support from |
|                   | regular members.                                 |
|                   |                                                  |
|                   | So lets say members of caucus support D,E,G, I,  |
|                   | K, M and O.                                      |
|                   |                                                  |
|                   | They can't beat A and B but other five can be    |
|                   | determined by caucus.                            |

**Counterorganization**

Since you can conspire in secrete forever. The only defense against
organization of the caucus is counterorganization. But caucus technique
can be successfully used even against organized opposition.

The emergence of counterorganization leads to creation of parties.
Everyone would want to maximize their power, so they need to align all
possible members.

He argues that it is also simplify the persuasion of the voters because
now they have only two places to vote for. In other words, unsolicited
voters and members are basically already half persuaded.

How would party system would work with parliament of 300 and the
election of the chair for the same committee.

He assumes that 75 members may be absent during the vote. This mean that
in order to receive majority parties need 113 votes. Let's say each
party has 75 members and 75 just independents.

In this case even though that we have organized opposition 75
independents + 75 absent basically gave up their power to organized
members. So, it is still a good strategy for parties.

Intensified competition between tow caucuses has two principal effects:

1.  Extension of area of competition. From dynamic in parliament to
    election and enlist the whole country in conflict

2.  Enlargement of electorate (suffrage) parties want to maximize their
    potential so at some point they will want to enlarge the electorate.

**The expansion of the electorate:**

Claims that parties liberalize the franchise wee ahead of the demand. So
the suffrage movements has to be explained in terms of party
competition.

Two stages of evolution of party organization:

1.  The rise of party organization in congress

2.  The development of party organization in the electorate

> He gives an example of Jefferson and Andrew Jackson who laid the
> ground for development of party organization in the electorate.

**The simplification of the alternatives**

Reduction of number of candidates

Frame the question and define the issue

Government system is too complicated so parties make it very simple for
the public
