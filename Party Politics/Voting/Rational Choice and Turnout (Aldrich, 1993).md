# Long Summary

**John Aldrich**

**"Rational Choice and Turnout"**

**Intro:**

-   Turning out to vote is the most common and most important aspect of
    political participation in a democracy

    -   Voting less understood

    -   [Turnout, however, a special problem for rational choice
        theories]{.underline}

    -   "The paradigmatic example of collective action problem" (all may
        benefit from voting, but not in individual's self-interest to
        vote) (246)

-   Paper will show basic model for turnout in rational choice, show
    that it is incomplete, add two alternative models (calculus of
    voting, minimax regret model), then their strengths and weaknesses
    analyzed → goal: to enrich theory

**The basic model (all rational choice accounts agree on it):**

-   Fundamental equation: largely agreed on in scholarship: preferences
    → behavior

-   Hypothetical set-up:

    -   One ballot, two candidates

    -   Voter has three choices:

        -   Vote for A

        -   Vote for B

        -   Abstain

        -   Expected outcome: A wins, B wins, tie

    -   Voters preferences are defined through outcomes

    -   Preferences are transformed into utilities for outcomes
        (defining how much a citizens prefers one outcome over the
        other)

        -   Outcome 1: prefered candidate A wins: 1 utility

        -   Outcome 2: non-preferred candidate B wins: 0 utility

        -   Outcome 3: they tie, either one equally likely to win
            through i.e. coin toss: ½ utility

-   "Rational choice theories are theories about how the (expected)
    utility associated with outcomes generates or induces preferences
    for the particular actions at hand" (248)

-   Main assumption: an individual will prefer something that will give
    them more utility → actions are instruments to attain goals
    (instrumental theory)

-   There are costs to voting: obtaining information, processing it, and
    deciding what to do and the direct costs of registering and going to
    the polls.

    -   Abstaining also carries costs

-   The table below illustrates the costs C of a voter has to consider
    when going to the polls (i.e. considering what others might do):

Conclusions from the basic model:

-   If costs of voting increase, turnout should decline (registration
    laws were passed, poll taxes were raised, or residency requirements
    were enacted, turnout fell)

-   If value between A and B declines (it doesn't matter who wins),
    turnout should also decline even if costs are relatively low →
    because then even those low costs with no preference in the game
    become unbearable

-   Now the author elaborates and enriches the model through additional
    theory

**The calculus of voting model:**

-   Downs (1957), Riker and Ordeshook (1968)

<!-- -->

-   The hallmark of this model is use of expected utility, assuming that
    citizens estimate the probability of the various states of the world
    (251)

-   A decision-theoretical model

-   Downs added a term, D, to represent the value of seeing democracy
    continue (251) → if no one votes, system fails (some vote to ensure
    it continues)

-   Riker and Ordeshook expanded his logic. Calling it \"citizen duty,\"
    they argued that D represents the value of doing one\'s duty as a
    citizen, as well as an array of other values, such as expressing
    support for the country and the political system (251)

    -   Expressive component of the vote, getting value just from voting
        without any regard for outcome

-   In Fiorina\'s (1976) terms, voting on this basis is an act of
    \"consumption,\" a citizen \"consumes\" voting for its own sake,
    rather than voting being an act of investment (see also Crain and
    Deaton 1977; Hinich 1981). Fiorina added to D such concerns as
    expressing allegiance to a favored candidate or party (251)

-   The key innovation of the calculus of voting is that each individual
    assigns a probability of each state of the world being true.8 What
    is critical is the probability that one vote will make a difference,
    that is, that column 3 or 4 is true. Calling the probability that
    one vote (for A) will make or break a tie, P, and calling the
    difference in utility for A instead of B winning B (for the
    difference in \"benefits\") (252)

    -   **R=PB + D - C** (R being the rewards from voting)

    -   If R positive, vote for A; if not, abstain

    -   P captures consideration of what others might do (A large P
        term, therefore, reflects closeness of the expected vote and
        size of the electorate (252))

-   the conclusion of the calculus of voting is that probability
    estimates are used to close the remaining gap in the basic model of
    turn- out. Holding all else constant, the higher the P term, the
    more likely it is that an individual will vote (252)

**Minimax Regret Model:**

-   Ferejohn and Fiorina (1974, 1975) reject completing the basic model
    by assuming that people form probability assessments of the states
    of the world (253)

    -   Might not be able to do so

-   In place of expected utility maximization, they propose that people
    use the decision rule called \"minimax regret" (253)

-   The \"regret\" question is to ask, \"If it turns out that a given
    state of the world is true, would you have any regret that you chose
    the action (voted or abstained) that you did, and if so, how much
    regret?"

-   Calculating regret happens through the basic decision model (from
    above) to find highest utility from action

-   This rule provides a complete specification of the decision-making
    problem, just as does the calculus of voting. Both yield the same
    results as the basic model; never vote for B, abstain if costs are
    prohibitively high (C \> 1/2), and so forth. The two models differ
    over how to handle the middle columns (256)

<!-- -->

-   Ferejohn and Fiorina argue that "minimax regret leads to turnout
    more often whenever the probability of casting the tie-making or
    tie- breaking vote is less than one-half. Their argument, then, is
    that P, if it could be formed, is (almost) always smaller than that,
    so minimax regret predicts turnout for more people more often than
    does the calculus of voting" (256)

**Game theoretic accounts:**

-   Above discussed models assume that no one decision is affecting the
    decision of others

-   Game theory explicitly accounts for others' decisions

-   true strategic interaction becomes attenuated as the size of the
    electorate increases, thus making game-theoretic solutions similar
    to the decision rule derived from the calculus of voting (257)

**Problems with calculus of voting:**

-   The first problem is the D term.

    -   Barry (1970) pointed out that the strongest relationship appears
        to be due to the D ter

    -   "the theoretical problem is that, if all the \"action\" is in
        the D term, turnout is not usefully understood by rational
        choice theory. To be sure, voting due to a high D term is
        perfectly rational. The answer to why someone voted, however, is
        simply that they valued voting on its own. If so, turnout is,
        effectively, noninstrumental. (258)

    -   Thus, theoretically, if turnout is due to the D term, rational
        choice models add nothing to the explanation of how preferences
        shape actions (258)

-   Second "theoretically consequential problem concerns the P term"
    (258)

    -   Simply put, in any large electorate, there is no reasonable
        basis for asserting that your vote will make or break a tie
        (258)

**Problems with minimax regret model:**

-   Again the P term:

    -   The question is not what specific probabilities people assign.
        The question is do people believe that there is any chance of an
        election being decided by exactly one vote, and can they do so
        without calculating (or using) probability terms systematically?
        (259)

-   Second problem, again with probability:

    -   The calculus of voting applied to multicandidate or multiparty
        elections predicts that some may well (rationally) choose to
        vote for a second-ranked party or candidate, rather than their
        first choice, to avoid \"wasting\" their vote on someone who has
        no chance of winning.\" Ferejohn and Fiorina (1974) show that
        the minimax regret model predicts that all voters will vote for
        their first choice. There is no wasted voting logic consistent
        with their model (259)

    -   It turns out that there is consistent evidence of the
        wasted-vote account in multiparty systems (Black 1978; Cain
        1978), in voting in U.S. presidential primaries (Abramson et al.
        1992), and perhaps in the three-candidate presidential contests
        (260)

    -   Can't have one theory for two person voting, and have that
        theory not hold in other types of voting scenarios

**Rationality of Turnout:**

-   The author suggests that turnout is not a good example of the
    problem of collective action

-   for many people most of the time, a low-cost, low-benefit action
    (261)

-   Turnout is a decision almost always made \"at the margin.\" Small
    changes in costs and benefits alter the turnout decision for many
    citizens. This argument applies to the basic model and thus all
    further formulations (261)

-   Models have basic assumption that only one race takes places,
    whereas the US ballot is filled with numerous contests → unclear how
    to model turnout in such cases

-   Niemi (1976) argued that costs of voting are ordinarily low for most
    people, most of the time. With liberalization of registration laws,
    it is no longer as difficult or time-consuming to become registered.
    It does not take that long to vote, and for most people polling
    places are not that far away (261)

-   Downs (1957) pointed out that many people come to the vote decision
    with \"accidental\" (or incidental) information. (262)

    -   Presidential elections, for instance, highly covered

-   Additionally, "most contests are partisan, and with the party
    affiliation of the candidates clearly labeled on the ballot,
    acquisition of this bit of information is very cheap. Even in an era
    of partisan dealignment, most citizens report at least some partisan
    leanings. V. 0. Key, Jr. (1966), referred to party identification as
    a \"standing decision"" (263)

-   recent studies have analyzed new informational shortcuts (such as
    voting retrospectively or for the incumbent in congressional
    elections) that also reduce decision-making costs.

**Some Initial Consequences of Low-cost, Low-Benefit Choice:**

-   Costs low, (expected) benefits also low

-   [Decision to vote will be made at the margins, small changes in the
    costs, can have dramatic impacts on turnout rates]{.underline} →
    politicians are aware of that (there are tactics on how to
    increase/decrease voter turnout)

-   This explains, according to the author [several implications and
    conclusions]{.underline} of the turnout literature (264):

-   **1.** [Many variables are related to turnout]{.underline}; they are
    related to turnout consistently in study after study, election after
    election, but they are [often moderately or weakly related to
    turnout]{.underline}.

-   **2.** Since turnout is, however, a close call for the typical
    citizen, we still do not know why the absolute level of turnout is
    what it is; [we do not know, fundamentally, why some people vote and
    others do not]{.underline}. It may be a chimera to believe that we
    could assess all of the small bits of benefits and costs involved in
    the turnout decision. Therefore, it may be a chimera to expect to
    have a complete answer to \"Who votes?\" precisely because it is a
    low- cost, low-benefit decision.

-   **3.** Citizens may make many \"errors\" in these decisions, since
    it is not worth much effort to decide whether R really is positive
    (or B is greater than 1/4). In the aggregate, these \"errors\" might
    cancel out, but individual decisions will be consistent with these
    theoretical principles only probabilistically and not with the
    certainty implied by the theoretical equations.

-   **4.** [Measurement error should also loom large in model
    estimation]{.underline}, attenuating estimates.

-   The fifth points is an important theoretical issue:

    -   **5.** Turnout is seen as a very central problem in rational
        choice theory because it is seen as the major and archetypical
        example of the problem of collective action. The turnout
        decision is an example of a collective action problem, *but it
        is not a very good, nor even terribly problematic, example of
        it*. The problem of collective action is, in large part, that
        people who share the same values for collective choices may find
        it difficult to attain and maintain the ability to act on those
        shared interests, precisely because there is little individual
        efficacy in action. While turnout is a collective action
        problem, it is not a good illustration because it differs from
        almost all other important collective action problems in a
        crucial regard. *Collective action problems typically assume
        importance because they are high-cost, high (potential) benefit
        decisions, where small P terms mean that the high B terms are
        substantially discounted. Turnout is a low-cost, low- benefit
        decision and sheds little light on most important collective
        action problems*. (emphasis added by Jenny)

-   **6.** The author suspects that the low-cost, low-benefit nature of
    the turnout decision really means that most of the action is, in
    fact, *in the intrinsic values of voting per se* (i.e., in C and D
    terms). After all, these apply directly to the voter,
    regardless (266) → can voting be really nonstrategic and non
    instrumental?

**Strategic Politicians and Strategic Turnout:**

-   Economic conditions matter in an election, as they weaken an
    incumbent\'s advantage, which in turn can be of a supportive nature
    for strong challengers, which affects the size of the campaigns
    (spending wise, research points to relation of money and turnout),
    which in turn can attract more voter (increase the size of turnout)

<!-- -->

-   **7**. Strategic politicians will invest more heavily in the closest
    contests, and this investment will be reflected in increasing levels
    of turnout, even if voters do not consider the closeness of the
    contest. Hence, turnout should increase with the closeness of the
    contest at the aggregate level, even if perceived closeness is
    weakly related, or even entirely unrelated, to the turnout decision
    of any individual voter. Indeed, voters can be purely expressive
    voters or \"consumers\" -they could decide purely on the basis of C
    and D kinds of variables-and still a correlation would exist between
    closeness and turnout at the aggregate level (268)

-   More generally, empirical studies have consistently found that
    campaign efforts by parties and other groups stimulate turnout (268)

-   The author uses Martin van Buren's campaign to illustrate that mass
    mobilization can affect voter turnout (1828, 1832)

-   The author also argues that the strategic politicians hypothesis
    also can help explain why there is consistent evidence of the
    wasted-vote thesis (under minimax should never happen, under
    calculus of voting should only happen a little bit if P is
    relatively small). (269)

-   The author uses the example of the 1968 and 1980 presidential
    elections, in which the third party candidates had much higher
    polling results in September than they had in November → which was
    due to major party intervention in campaigning to highlight the
    uselessness of voting for them

-   **8.** Strategic politicians inform voters of the wasted-vote
    argument and convince at least some voters that it is sensible to
    act as \"strategic voters.\" (270)

**The decline of turnout and a broader theory of preference:**

-   Most studied aspect of presidential and congressional turnouts is
    the fact that since 1960 both of them have been declining

-   How to make sense of that with rational choice models
    (election-specific models)

-   P doesn't really make sense for route to explain

-   B doesn't apply well either to go down that path (as presidents have
    come from all parts of the spectrum, no other clear patterns emerge
    from the past elections)

-   Changing costs unlikely explanation (material costs have been
    reduced), campaigning efforts have increased rapidly

-   Riker/Ordeshook's duty term not actual explanation

-   While elections specific models might not be completely useless,
    they are - so the author insufficient to explain turnout results

-   A decline in turnout is affected by long-term attitudinal changes
    and some demographic variables (literature/research has shown
    ability of party identification to predict turnout both
    cross-sectionally and over time)

    -   External efficacy has also declined

    -   Other variables, such as residential mobility, have also been
        suggested

    -   Not election-specific variables

-   How to reconcile the fact that rational choice model is affected by
    non-election-specific variables?

    -   Author: simple, reexamine the D term

    -   Fiorina: it can also include party affiliation

        -   If that takes place then party affiliation decline included
            in the model

        -   Its decline captures declining attachment to the parties
            (and who wins) in general

        -   D essentially becomes part of B

    -   A decline in external efficacy also means that it doesn't matter
        which candidate gets elected, because the perceived ability of
        either one to accomplish anything is low (which affects B)

-   Final conclusions:

    -   **9.** [The D term]{.underline} is not \"politically inert\" but
        [may include highly political, even election-specific,
        values]{.underline}. The D term may also conflate investment
        with consumption factors (further suggesting why consumption
        terms appear so consequential).

    -   **10**. If D includes, in part, B-like considerations, then the
        strategic politicians hypothesis provides even greater empirical
        leverage, as strategic politicians can both \"manipulate\" costs
        and, perhaps, sense of duty and stimulate turnout strategically,
        based on benefits.

    -   **11.** An [expanded view of the elements of D provides that
        ability to open the rational-choice account of voting to include
        long-term beliefs and values, as well as election-specific
        ones]{.underline}. As a result, the model can be seen to be
        consistent with many explanations of the decline in turnout.

**To conclude:**

1)  **turnout decision is a marginal decision with low costs and low
    (expected) benefits for many people (274)**

2)  **turnout is not a particularly good example of the problem of
    collective action because it is a relatively minor one (274)**

3)  **many variables affect turnout because anything that affects
    benefits or costs even slightly can change individuals\' choices
    (274)**

4)  **it is very difficult, perhaps practically impossible, to explain
    just who does and who does not vote in some absolute sense (274)**

5)  **marginality of the decision to turn out also provides an
    opportunity for political leaders and groups to affect turnout
    through their strategic action (strategic politician hypothesis)
    (274)**

6)  **D term has been overly narrowly interpreted in ways that remove it
    from the politics of election campaigns (275)**

7)  **benefits part of the turnout equation has been interpreted too
    narrowly as election specific or as long-term forces that are
    \"beyond politics.\" We should, instead, see non-election-specific
    forces as reflecting longer-term political values and preferences
    (275)**

8)  **Basically, models work for analyzing turnout and predicting it,
    but they have been all interpreted too narrowly which miss a lot of
    points about campaigning and elections**
