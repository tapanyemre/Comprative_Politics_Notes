# Long Summary

*Most of this is directly from the text*

**Key Takeaways:**

-   ï»¿Fertilizer is key to agricultural productivity

-   In this paper the authors argue that just as behavioral biases limit
    investment in attractive financial investment in pension plans by
    workers in the US, they may limit profitable investments in
    fertilizer by farmers in developing countries.

-   The model proposed in this paper suggests that small, time-limited
    discounts can potentially help present-biased farmers commit to
    fertilizer use and thus over-come procrastination problems, while
    minimally distorting the investment decisions of farmers who do not
    suffer from such problems

-   Small, time-limited subsidies may therefore be attractive

-   They would increase fertilizer use for present-biased farmers for
    whom higher fertilizer use would be optimal but would create minimal
    distortions for farmers who are satisfying their first-order
    conditions for fertilizer application initially, unlike heavy
    subsidies

-   Small, time-limited subsidies are likely to yield higher welfare
    than either heavy subsidies or laissez-faire

-   IV: fertilizer purchases

-   DV: welfare

-   Causal Mechanism: bias
