# Long Summary

**Ronald Rogowski**

**"Political Cleavages and changing exposure to trade"**

**Puzzle:** Why do countries have political cleavages among owners of of
land, labor, and capital? And why do they change?

**Previously used explanations:** pre-existing cultural and religious
divisions, rapidity and timing of industrialization, mass suffrage,
electoral system, crises of modernization, product cycle

**Author's contribution:** externally induced changes in exposure to
international trade (in countries with different factor endowments)
*(Wiki: "In economics a country\'s factor endowment is commonly
understood as the amount of land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship
that a country possesses and can exploit for manufacturing.")*

Author argues that the basic results of theory of international trade
(i.e. Stolper Samuelson Theorem) "imply that increases or decreases in
the costs and difficulty of international trade should powerfully affect
domestic political cleavages and should do so differently in countries
with different factor endowments".

The Stolper Samuelson Theorem is summarized as followed: In any society,
protection benefits owners of factors in which that society is poorly
endowed and producers who use the scarce factors intensively
(liberalization of trade harms those). Protection harms owners of
factors the given society holds abundantly relative to the rest of the
world and producers who use the abundant factors intensively.

According to the author exogenous factors can have the same effects as
increasing or decreasing protections (meaning changes to international
trade). The author, therefore, wants to know what the political
consequences of shifts of wealth and income are.

When it comes to domestic processes, the two following assumptions are
made by the author:

*Assumption 1:* if an individual/group benefits from change, they will
try to continue and accelerate it; victims will try to halt or reverse
it

*Assumption 2:* those who enjoy sudden increase in wealth/income will be
enabled to expand their political influence

In regards to international trade, the author assumes the following for
his model:

*Assumption 1:* gainers from any exogenous change will seek to continue
and expand free trade, losers will seek protections

*Assumption 2:* those who gain in international trade will increase
their political power

The author adopts the traditional three factor model of land, labor,
capital. In this model the land-labor ratio fully informs the reader
about any country's endowment (no country can be rich/poor in both).

The author argues that any country can be placed in the model below
based on its land-labor ratio and its capital (advanced or backwards):

Out of these configurations, according to the Stolper Samuelson Theorem,
of the three factors follow two types of conflicts with political
consequences:

1)  **Capital rich, land rich, labor poor → class conflict,**
    capitalists/agriculture will seek expansion/power, labor will seek
    protection

2)  **Capital rich, land poor, labor rich** → **urban-rural conflict**,
    expanding exposure to trade positive for capitalists/workers (expand
    political influence), harms landowners (protectionists)

3)  **Capital poor, land rich, labor poor** → **urban-rural conflict,**
    expansion will affect capitalists/workers poorly, only agriculture
    will gain (will want to expand powers)

4)  **Capital poor, land poor, labor rich → class conflict,** laborers
    will seek expansion, capitalists/agriculture will seek protections

The author applies the model to several case studies in the past
centuries to illustrate that it actually works and explains cleavages. I
have included an image from the text, which demonstrates some of his
examples used, when trade, for instance, declines.

Political consequences of declining exposure to trade:



Further, the author uses four time periods as additional analyses to
highlight what exogenous shocks to the international trade regime can do
to several countries with different factor endowments (I have picked out
some to highlight the issue).

1)  "Long" 16th century: improvements in navigation and shipbuilding,
    expansion of trade created both types of conflicts in changing
    economies (northern Europe, southern Europe)

2)  19th century: the cheapening of transportations; Britain (as other
    northern European countries) urban-rural conflict
    (capitalist/laborers vs land owners); Germany (poor capital, land
    poor, labor rich) class conflict (laborers press for more,
    capitalists/agriculture protectionism); USA (land rich, labor poor,
    capital poor) rural-urban conflict from the agriculture side
    demanding more power

3)  Depression of the 1930s: USA (Canada, Australia, NZ) capital rich,
    land rich, labor scarce, collapse of international trade benefited
    labor, left policies; further examples of how model fits reality
    p.1129

4)  After WW2: new economies in transportation and communication, West
    experiences one of biggest expansions to international trade; Europe
    and Japan (capital rich, labor rich, land poor) see labor and
    capital unite → urban rural conflict; USA, AUS, NZ (capital rich,
    land rich, labor poor) → class conflict, suppression of labor

Additionally, the author argues that this model can solve some
additional riddles in domestic politics. I have listed them below:

1.  "Latecomers" to the economy: for labor rich countries it is
    important to note whether development precedes or follows
    significant exposure to trade. If capital accumulated before
    expansion, labor and capital will work in relative harmony, little
    state intervention required. If expansion happens before capital
    accumulation, labor will face protectionism desires from capital and
    land-owners. A stronger state will be needed.

> In latecomer countries where land is abundant and labor scarce,
> modernization radicalizes owners of land. Then labor and capital unite
> in favor of protectionism. If no class-conflict occurs, no powerful
> state is needed.

2.  This model supposedly answers also the question why the US is no
    socialist country. According to the author, socialism wins in
    capital poor, labor rich, land poor countries.

3.  This model also solves the riddle of the coalitional basis and aims
    of the North in the U.S.Civil War. (protection and free soil aimed
    for by the Republican party). Protection and abolition would benefit
    workers and capitalists at the same time.

Lastly, the author admits that this model holds on rigidly to the
land-labor ratio, which the author acknowledges. Towards the end of the
paper he relaxes that assumption a bit. He assumes that a country can be
both rich or poor in both land and labor. By acknowledging such a
possibility, four new economic cases arise:

**Capital rich, land rich, labor rich** → according to author:
theoretically improbable, politically uninteresting (embrace trade)

**Capital poor, land poor, labor poor** → according to author:
theoretically improbable, politically uninteresting (if all scarce,
protectionism)

**Capital rich, land poor, labor poor** → agriculture, labor band
together, seek protections (Scandinavian countries 1930)

**Capital poor, land rich, labor rich** → agriculture and labor band
together, capital seeks protection (Russia after WW2)

Finally, the author addresses three objections readers might have when
reading his paper and analyzing his model. He lists them and then
promptly refutes them.

1.  **Effects mentioned here have no influence on countries that do not
    rely too much on trade (USA in 1960s, for instance).**

> → author refutes this argument by stating that the Stolper Samuelson
> Theorem supposedly always holds, even slight changes to trade have an
> impact
>
> 2\) **Will these three types of groups and their cleavages continue to
> exist? People are supposedly rational and would turn their backs on
> losing factors/enterprises, and then move to other factors; thus
> creating a new political equilibrium.**
>
> → author refutes: one, trade expands and contradicts quite rapidly in
> certain cases (series of exogenous shocks); sometimes a particular
> factors' privileged access to political influences makes extraction of
> rents/subsidies cheaper than adaptation.

**3) The author says nothing about the outcomes of these conflicts.**

> → model is speculation about cleavages, not outcome (nothing
> guarantees that winners will gain political power)

Over and over does the author highlights that his analysis is by no
means parsimonious, as additional factors, such as cultures, loyalties,
and religions, cannot be ignored. However, he does argue that a model,
like the Stolper Samuelson model embedded in political realities can
find a firm footing and can explain changes in political cleavages.
