# Long Summary

Easterly and Levine, "Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments
influence economic development"

-   Question: How and two what extent does geographical endowment
    influence economic development?

<!-- -->

-   DV: development

-   IVs: geography, institutions, macroeconomic policies

<!-- -->

-   Methods: sample of 72 former colonies

-   Proxies:

    -   Geographic endowments:

        i.  Settler mortality

            -   Increased mortality, decreased development

        ii. Latitude

            -   Incrased latitude, increased development

        iii. crops/minerals (dummy variable)

        iv. Landlocked (dummy)

    -   Institutions - uses institutions index which includes:

        i.  Voice and accountability

        ii. Political stability and absence of violence

        iii. Government effectiveness

        iv. Light regulatory burden

        v.  Rule of law

        vi. Freedom from graft

    -   Macroeconomic policies:

        i.  Openness (interference with foreign trade)

        ii. Real exchange rate overvaluation

        iii. Inflation

-   Results:

    -   Endowments explain variation in economic development

    -   Endowments explain variation in institutional development

    -   BUT endowments do not explain economic development outside of
        institutions

        -   "Endowments explain institutions, which in turn explain
            economic development."

    -   Macroeconomic policies do not explain economic development after
        accounting for endowments/institutions
