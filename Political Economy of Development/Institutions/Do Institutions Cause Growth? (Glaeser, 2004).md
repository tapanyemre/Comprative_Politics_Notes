# Long Summary



"Do institutions cause growth?"

-   Question: Do institutions cause economic growth?

<!-- -->

-   Analyzes two broad approaches

1.  Start with democratic institutions to secure property rights →
    investment in human and physical capital → economic growth

2.  Start with human and physical capital (with policy choices securing
    property rights) → economic growth → democratic institutions

-   The authors align more with approach 2, but note that no studies of
    this are conclusive

<!-- -->

-   DV: economic growth as a result of property rights

-   IVs:

    -   human capital (government chooses policy - can be dictatorship)

    -   Institutions (government is constrained to choose a certain
        policy

<!-- -->

-   South and North Korea as examples, show that institutions are a
    consequence of economic growth, which is a consequence of policy
    choices

<!-- -->

-   Common measures of institutions can't be used to establish causality

<!-- -->

-   Methods:

    -   \- sample of poor countries after 1960 divided into low, medium,
        and high human capital (years of schooling used as a proxy)

-   Lowest education countries are never stable democracies

-   Highest education countries are either stable or imperfect
    democracies

<!-- -->

-   Evidence isn't conclusive, but suggests that focus on growth in
    human capital, rather than placing institutional constraints on
    government, is more effective in emergence from poverty

<!-- -->

-   **"\... countries that emerge from poverty accumulate human and
    physical capital under dictatorships, and then, once they have
    become richer, are increasingly likely to improve their
    institutions." (298)**
