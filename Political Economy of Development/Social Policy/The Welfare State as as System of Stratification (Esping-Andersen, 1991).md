# Long Summary




**The Welfare State as as System of Stratification**

-   Welfare states as key institutions in defining social class and
    social structure

-   Majority of theoretical literature focuses on

    -   a\) the welfare state simply reproducing existing class
        structures

    -   b\) that welfare eliminates the causes of class struggle

-   Empirically the literature has mainly focused on income
    redistribution

    -   Cross-sectional studies variants in the capabilities of the
        welfare state to equalize (Germany/France vs Scandinavian
        countries)

-   No one really discussing the *why* of this phenomenon

-   The author names several studies that show that at least in the
    Scandinavian countries the welfare state seems to be working to
    reduce poverty

    -   But: even with declining poverty and increasing living
        conditions, cleavages among the society can (and still do) exist

-   Apart from income distribution the welfare state impacts class and
    status in a variety of ways (i.e. education, social services for
    women, etc.)

-   This chapter will focus, nonetheless, on i*ncome maintenance*.

-   Welfare states may be universal and largely comprehensive, yet they
    can have different effects on the social structure in different
    countries and will produce its own form of social solidarity

    -   May cultivate hierarchy/status

    -   Dualism

    -   Or even universalism

-   This chapter will:

    -   I*dentify three models, or ideal types, of stratification and
        solidarity that closely parallel the regime-types we identified
        with respect to decommodification*

1)  [Stratification in Conservative Social Policy]{.underline}

-   Traditional status relations must be retained for the sake of social
    integration

-   Authoritarian paternalistic conservatism:

    -   Principles: hierarchy, authority, and direct subordination of
        the individual to the patriarch/the state

    -   State directly guiding economic activities of the state

    -   Promoted in Germany/Austria (i.e. Bismarck)

    -   Bismarck's social insurance scheme: *etatist paternalism* (with
        concessions to the liberals and conservative corporativism)

        -   Left impact on traditions in Austria/Germany/France

            -   Endowing civil servants with lavish welfare provisions
                (maybe to retain loyalty, but also evidence shows to
                mold a specific class)

            -   Evolution of social assistance

    -   As response to fragmentation of society and individualism of the
        liberated markets: *corporatism*

        -   Principles: fraternity based on status identity, obligatory
            and exclusive membership, mutualism, and monopoly of
            representaiton

            -   Built around occupational groupings seeking to uphold
                traditionally recognized status distinction,
                organizational nexus for society and the economy
                (modeled on old guilds)

            -   Emerged among privileged works, or erected with state
                participation

            -   Creates confusing system of many many pension schemes

            -   Strongest hold in European countries, especially in
                Fascist regimes of 1920s and 1930s

[2) Stratification in Liberal Social Policy]{.underline}

-   Saw the conditions for individual emancipation, freedom, equal
    opportunity, and healthy competitiveness in the abolition of
    estates, guilds, monopolies, and central monarchical absolutism
    (61/62)

-   State stays out of regulation economy, not necessarily implies
    passiveness in organizing societal structure, just that state had no
    role in correcting the results of the stratification caused by the
    markets

-   Principles (ideals): universalism and equality

-   No state, no monopolies → no classes, a web of freely acting
    individuals (62)

-   In practice, though, promoted dualism and social stigma

    -   Liberal state established an extraordinarily punitive and
        stigmatizing poor relief for the market failures (stigma, social
        humiliation of receiving aid)

    -   I,e. in Britain: liberalism created a society of two nations

-   Liberal reform movement originates to Lloyd George in Britains

    -   Rampant poverty, disease, misery among the urban working
        classses

    -   New type of capitalism was being born (one in which the last
        drop of sweat and blood could not be squeezed out of workers)

    -   Biggest changes came from coporate liberalists

        -   Sponsor larger measures of collectivism

        -   Acknowledging problem of externalities

        -   Need for public good

        -   Policies of help to self-help (mass-education, sponsored
            equal opportunity)

        -   Leaning more and more to social insurance (state as
            insurance-carrier) for the definitively poor

            -   Nonetheless, kept at minimum to encourage activity to
                not interfere with private-pension market and
                individualism

[3) Stratification in Socialist Social Policy]{.underline}

-   Construction of solidarity matters for labor movements

-   Struggled not just against the bourgeoisie but against a myriad of
    alternatives of stratification amongst its own ranks

    -   Obstacles:

        -   Persistent unemployment → dualism

        -   Social divisions institutionalized by earlier conservative
            and liberal reforms (poor law system drove wedge into
            proletariat)

    -   Abolition of means-test and less-eligibility rules became top
        priority

    -   Attacked sponsored paternalistic welfare for corporativistic
        consequences

    -   Attacked state insurance for workers as institutionalized
        inequality

<!-- -->

-   Social policy would have to do two things

    -   Address real need of social relief

    -   Help the socialist movement come to power

        -   Or alternatively rely on unions to get collective bargaining

-   Third alternative:

    -   Micro-socialist ghetto strategy

        -   Movement itself becomes provide of workers' welfare

    -   Constructed organizational empires with a ton of different
        facilities and clubs

    -   Problems:

        -   Build class solidarity and power by mobilizing through
            membership

            -   If financed by workers themselves, victim to economic
                crises

        -   Dualism: members vs non-members

-   Compelled (in order to gain power) to adopt genuine universal idea
    of solidarity

    -   This principle emerged with extension and consolidation of
        democratic rights

    -   I.e. Scandinavians

-   Coincidence between universalism and democracy not accidental (67)

    -   Universalism: voter maximization

    -   Equalized status, benefits, and responsibilities of citizenships

[4) Comparative Dimensions of Welfare-State Stratification]{.underline}

-   To identify welfare-state clusters, need to identify the salient
    dimensions of stratification

    -   (look above for all the various types of stratification)

-   Pages 70-72 have a list of countries and the degrees of different
    types of stratifications (can have multiple in one → hybrid
    versions)

-   Page 74 has a chart of the clustering of welfare state countries
    according to conservatism, liberalism, and socialist regime type
    (according to strong, medium, low)

[5) Conclusion]{.underline}

-   Misleading to compare welfare states as merely more or less
    egalitarian

-   Entirely different logics of social stratification in welfare-state
    construction

-   Clustering of decommodification and stratification is similar (high
    d, strong universalism; low d, strong individualist self-reliance)
