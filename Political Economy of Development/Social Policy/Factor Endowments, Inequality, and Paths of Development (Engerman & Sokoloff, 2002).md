# Long Summary


Engerman, Stanley L. and Kenneth L. Sokoloff. 2002. \"Factor Endowments,
Inequality, and Paths of Development among New World Economies.\"
*EconomÃ­a* 3 (1):41-109.

**IV**: Factor Endowments

**Values IV**: land, soil, native populations, etc (initial endowments)

**DV:** Equality/inequality of institutions

**Nutshell**: This piece studies the sources of institutions and their
relation to long term paths of econ development, studying the former
colonial societies of the New World.

**RQ:** did extreme differences in equality that arose early in the
histories of New World economies contribute to the systematic
differences in the way institutions evolved?

**Findings**: generally, countries that begin w/ extreme inequality tend
to generate institutions that were more restrictive and favored elites
more than did societies that began w/ more equality.

**Methodology**-colonization patterns provide a natural experiment

**Key takeaways:**

-   The authors want to examine why different rates of growth occurred
    in different former colonies

-   They highlight the fundamental importance of extreme differences
    across these societies that were present from their beginnings
    (inequality in distributions of wealth etc) and due largely to
    differences in factor endowments/initial conditions

    -   Endowments of soil that could foster plantation-scale farming
        led to greater import of slaves and more inequality

    -   NOTE: the authors only differentiate the slaveholding Southern
        US as unequal in the beginning, eventually (post-Civil War) they
        say it catches up and is more in line with the equality in the
        North and Canada. This is a major blind spot to me, because
        inequality was institutionalized and entrenched in ways other
        than slavery and still exists today

        -   Northern US and Canada didn't have conditions that would
            have benefitted from a lot of slaves working the land and
            inequality was lesser (also really problematic/they also way
            underrepresented the presence of Native or First Nations
            people)

        -   This led to institutions that reflected relatively equal
            distributions of wealth and human capital

    -   Greater equality -\> democratic politics, public goods,
        infrastructure, broad access to econ opportunities

    -   Extreme inequality-less democratic, limited investments in
        public goods/infrastructure, institutions evolved to greatly
        advantage elites

    -   So, factor endowments -\> degree of inequality, which then
        impacted paths of development

-   Across policies and institutions related immigration, public lands,
    suffrage, schooling, and finance, the initial extent of inequality
    mattered.

    -   More initial equality -\> institutions more likely to make
        opportunities more equally accessible

-   Early industrialization seemed to favor the more equal New World
    Economies

**Their Conclusion**
