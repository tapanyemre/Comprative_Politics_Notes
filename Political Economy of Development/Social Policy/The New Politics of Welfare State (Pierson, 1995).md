# Long Summary
Pierson

Politics of New Welfare State

Pierson argues that old welfare state theories don\'t explain new
welfare state post 1970s. Original ones were designed to explain welfare
state expansion, not retrenchment.

Pierson argues that interest groups and voters are central constraints
on welfare state policy retrenchment.

Negativity bias: individuals take more chances, seek conflict, and take
more risks if they stand to lose something than to gain something.

Alternative explanations:

-   Strong economies produce strong welfare states (Wilensky). Doesn\'t
    help us explain variation among strong economies.

-   Social dumping - firms in countries with low social wages (eg.
    Social security wage deductions, taxes, etc.) can produce goods at
    cheaper prices and out-compete other countries. To remain
    competitive, governments make welfare poli y retrenchment

-   Politicians worry first and foremost about getting reelected, not
    passing competitive economic policy. They court unions, etc. But
    what if unions become less powerful? Does welfare policy
    automatically become weaker?

-   Institutionalist theory 1: states with strong administrative
    capacity have strong welfare policies. Federalism, separation of
    powers, etc. limits welfare policies

-   Institutionalist theory 2: policies create long-term policy lockin
    and feedback cycles, especially in pay as you go systems like social
    security, because voters lose out if they give up on a system.

Pierson\'s argument

-   Non-decisions favor the welfare state

-   Politicians only support welfare reform when it does not put them at
    risk of losing the next election

Three situations where reform occurs:

-   When govt has enough electoral slack, meaning they can pursue
    unpopular policies because they have such a strong lead in polls and
    so won\'t suffer huge losses from reduced popularity

-   Moments of budgetary crisis, where reform can be framed as a crisis
    solution (eg. The case of the US, debt ceiling, and austerity
    measures)

-   When institutions allow for minimal visibility of policy actions,
    retrenchment occurs more. When institutions involve greater
    transparency, retrenchment does not occur, because politicians fear
    they\'ll lose support.

-   Reforms occur more often when government can alter institutions to
    suit their needs.

Class Notes:

-   Welfare Retrenchment involves specific costs and diffuse benefits to
    society, so it's hard to get support because you'll have loud
    opposition.

-   Welfare Expansion involves diffuse costs and specific benefits, so
    it's easy to get support, because you'll have weak opposition.
    (*Thanks Garrett!*)

\* Why do we not see retrenchment for things like the rights of the
disabled? People reject specific costs much more than diffuse costs.
