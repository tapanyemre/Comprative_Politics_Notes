Banerjee & Duflo, *Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to
Fight Global Poverty* (2011)

This chapter was very simple. No real DV or IV discussed in the classic
sense.

**Big question: How do individuals emerge from poverty?**

Unit of analysis: Individual

Basically, they argue that the traditional arguments about poverty -
that there is a poverty trap that can be overcome by one-time injections
of aid (Sachs), and that aid actually reinforces longlasting poverty by
making individuals reliant on aid and destroying markets (Easterly) -
are not useful in a broad sense.

Instead, an analysis of poverty should be done on a case-by-case basis.

-   Methods: Randomized control trials (RCTs) - researchers work with
    local partner to implement large-scale experiments

    -   Groups are assigned different treatments so that interventions
        can be tested and variation in results are sure to be caused by
        the change in the intervention tested.

    -   One of these is not enough, but a series that differs
        geographically and/or in the intervention tested can help to
        develop a theory

    -   RCT ←→ intervention

Main argument is that poverty traps may exist, but they are not a given.
Everything should be taken case-by-case and based on RCTs and relevant
data. One overarching approach will not work. Must understand local
contexts, as well as the specific situation that an individual is in
before deciding whether aid will be helpful, and what form that aid
should take.
