W.W. Rostow, The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto
(Cambridge:

Cambridge University Press, \[1960\] 1990), pp. 1-12

Summary: Tim

**Introduction**

Rostow interrogates the 'stages of growth' (a sequencing hypothesis) as
a cause of development.

-   The introduction has massive disclaimers first about stage-of-growth
    theories.

-   Argues that politics is an important causal factor in the economy,
    not the other way around. \"Societies are interacting organism.\"

-   He thinks this view distinguishes him from Marx and Marxist
    scholars, who largely see politics as stemming from economic, class
    based issues.

**Chapter 2**

Rostow summarizes five stage of growth in Chapter 2:

-   traditional society

-   preconditions for take-off

-   take-off

-   drive to maturity

-   age of high mass consumption.

Traditional societies have limited production, pre-Newtonian science,
and attitudes

-   Ceiling on level of attainable output per head. Limited by science
    and lack of systematized production

-   Family and clan connections dominate; fatalism: the assumption that
    options open to ones grandchildren will be the same as had been for
    one\'s grandparents. But many strived to acquire or keep land in
    their lifetime, leading to struggle

-   Rostow thinks Britain was first to develop preconditions for take
    off due to geography. But most preconditions arrive exogenously by
    intrusion from more advanced societies.

-   Broke down values, political systems, and economies in traditional
    societies.

-   Education, people innovating in private economy, communication and
    transport changes.

Take-off is when old resistances to growth are overcome.

-   Growth and compound interest becomes built into institutional
    structure and habits.

-   For Britain and several of its colonies, technology caused take-off.

-   Generally, requires a build-up of overhead capital and technological
    development in industry and agriculture.

-   New industries expand rapidly, profits stimulating urban areas and
    other industries.

Drive to maturity - sustained or fluctuating progress.

-   Technology becomes front of economy; 10\~20% of national income
    invested in economy.

-   40\~60 years after take-off begins, maturity arrives.

-   Shift from coal, iron, and heavy engineering to machine-tools,
    chemicals, and electricity.

Age of High Mass-Consumption:

-   income per capita rises so that people buy more than basic food,
    shelter, and clothing.

-   High proportion of urban residents, skilled labor, service sector.

-   Japan, US, EU hit this in post-war.

<!-- -->

-   Beyond Consumption: People\'s preferences and values change. People
    start having diverse tastes, some having more children than others.

Rostow thinks these stages are a way of generalizing observations about
sequence of development, rooted in theory of production. He proposes a
new, dynamic theory of production. This would focus on the composition
of investment and sectors of the economy, disaggregated from the
straightforward growth hypothesis. Doing so allows us to make
predictions for distinct sectors of the economy.

It's a very short article. Hooray!
