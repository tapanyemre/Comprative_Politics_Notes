# Long Summary


**"Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective"**

-   Historians no longer understand themselves as the one-stop resource
    for all of human's answers; let alone to be in the position to imply
    historic determination

-   *The **purpose of this chapter** is to indicate, nonetheless, that
    there is some usefulness to the craft of historian*

-   Economic policies tend to be decisions made with regard to a
    combination of relevant factors within an isolated timeframe

-   Historians can look at a larger scale of potentially relevant
    factors and a potentially significant combinations which could have
    not been easily perceived within a more limited sphere of experience
    (aka the timeframe)

-   To stress again, no actual answers though to provide:

    -   *"No past experience, however rich, and no historical research,
        however thorough, can save the living generation the creative
        task of finding their own answers and shaping their own futures"
        (6)*

<!-- -->

-   When it comes to the economic development of "backward" countries
    (all in Europe) compared to developed countries one cannot make
    generalizations about the development process

-   The author counters here the Marx notion that "the industrially more
    developed country presents to the less developed country a picture
    of the latter's future" (6)

<!-- -->

-   The proposition of the chapter is (when looking at the story of
    European industrialization):

    -   "In a number of historical instances industrialization process,
        when launched at length in a backward country, showed
        considerable differences, as compared with more advanced
        countries, not only with regard to the speed of development (the
        rate of industrial growth) but also with regard to the
        productive and organizational structures of the industry which
        emerged from those processes" (7)

    -   "These differences in the speed and character of industrial
        development were to a considerable extent the result of
        application of institutional instruments for which there was
        little or no counterpart in an established industrial country"
        (7)

    -   Additionally the intellectual climate with which
        industrialization proceeded differed (differs) between backwards
        and developed countries

    -   Also, degree of backwardness differs in each instance

<!-- -->

-   The author then introduces a few basics of the industrialization
    process of backward countries :

    -   Before initiation of industrialization process the situation can
        be described as a tension between "*the actual state of economic
        activities in the country and the existing obstacles to
        industrial development, on the one hand, and the great promise
        inherent in such a development, on the other" (8)*

    -   No tension existed in places with certain institutional
        obstacles (i.e. serfdom of peasantry)

    -   Inherent opportunities varied with backwardness of country

    -   The more backlog technology available to borrow by backward
        countries the more promising industrialization seemed

        -   In actuality, however, the author notes that opportunities
            available for backward countries to rapidly develop in fact
            widened the gulf between what was possible and what was
            actually happening in terms of development in backward
            countries

    -   Several European examples (of large scale productions and
        periods of stagnation) show that only when production could
        happen on a large scale (on different economic fronts) was the
        tension in the country strong enough to overcome obstacles and
        "liberate the forces that made for industrial progress"

<!-- -->

-   These factors (above) which supposedly made for "higher speed of
    growth and different productive structure of industries" were
    supported by these countries' use of certain institutional
    instruments and the acceptance of specific industrialization
    instruments (11), of which the author addresses some below

1)  **Banks:**

-   Napoleon III ended a long stretch of economic stagnation in France

-   Destroying the "hothouse in which French industry had been kept for
    decades and exposed it to the stimulating atmosphere of
    international competition" (11) (i.e ending monopoly profits in coal
    and iron production)

-   However, France's industry received a big boost from a different
    area, "the development of industrial banking under Napoleon III"

-   It is not just about what new investment banks did to the country
    (building railroads, drill mines, erecting factories, canals, ports,
    etc.), they also changed the environment by going up against the old
    guard of banking (i.e. Rothschild), whose work up to that point had
    been limited to "floatation of government loans and foreign-exchange
    transactions" (13)

-   Bank modeled after the Pereire model were adopted all over the
    continent, especially in Germany ("universal bank"), supporting
    enterprises from cradle to grave

-   England developed industrially rather slowly and gradually. There
    was no need for banks for the purpose of long-term investments;
    capital accumulated considerably throughout different industries.

-   In relatively backward countries capital is scarce, distrust of
    industrial activities, and there is more pressure due to the scope
    of development (need for bigness), and the concentration on specific
    industries

    -   These types of pressure created different conditions on the
        continent and gave rise to a different type of banking system in
        those backward countries. The institution of the bank was thus
        used as a tool to boost industrialization.

    -   The author stipulate, though, that such usage of such a tool is
        only possible in "countries whose backwardness does not exceed
        certain limits" (15)

    -   The involvement of banks influenced the type of industry
        "popular" on the continent. Banks supported coal mining, iron
        and steelmaking, electrical and general engineering. On the
        fringes: textile, leather, foodstuff-producing.

    -   The banks' involvement also impacted the organizational
        structure of the industries (i.e. "cartelization movement in
        German industry cannot fully be explained, except as the natural
        result of the amalgamation of German banks")

**2) The state:**

-   German experience can certainly be generalized. Plenty of other
    countries on the continent exist with similar experiences (i.e.
    Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France, Belgium, etc.) â†’ [but it cannot
    be generalized to the whole continent]{.underline}

    -   1\) **"due to the existence of certain backward countries when
        no comparable features of industrial development can be
        discovered"** (i.e. Denmark, poor in natural resources,
        proximity to England influenced opportunities for agricultural
        improvement, no challenge obvious, therefore, no response in
        form of industrialization)

    -   2\) **"due to the existence of countries where the basic
        elements of backwardness appear in such an accentuated form as
        to lead the use of essentially different institutional
        instruments of industrialization"** (16) (i.e. Russia (they were
        late to the game), backwardness due to preservation of serfdom
        until emancipation of 1861, increased number of military
        conflicts with West lead to *"peculiar series of sequence" for
        economic development*: 1) state takes on role of primary
        agent, 2) development (rapid, slow) hinges on needs of
        military, 3) no continuous development put burden of increased
        activity on people who happen to be off-age when need for
        economic activity the biggest, 4) in order to get what the state
        needed, oppression of population necessary, 5) periods of rapid
        growth followed by periods of stagnation due to physical
        exhaustions)

        -   Sequence fits best with period of reforms under Peter the
            Great (but not confined to it)

        -   Trying to adapt to Western methods

        -   Think again of challenge-response mechanism:

            -   Size of challenge changed the quality of the response in
                Russia (result: retardation of economic development,
                other non economic consequences)

            -   Due to abysmal industrial conditions (corruption,
                dishonesty) no bank structure (ala Germany) could have
                been implemented; lack of capital required the state to
                step in show its taxation power

**3) The Gradations of Backwardness**

-   The author discusses in this part of his chapter the evolution of
    German and Russian industries

-   German industries eventually in the beginning of the 20th century
    emancipated themselves from their masters (aka the banks),
    essentially becoming an economically developed country.

-   Russia industry eventually no longer participated in this odd
    sequence and didn't experience stagnation. Rather, the role of the
    state was reduced, banks stepped in. Essentially a new stage of
    backwardness was created.

**4) Ideologies of Delayed Industrializations**

-   Here the author addresses certain ideological climates that existed
    in countries where the industrialization process took place.
    Ideology and sentiment seem to be necessary as well to get the
    industrialization process of the ground.

-   France: men who reached positions of economic and financial
    influence under Napoleon III were not isolated but belonged to a
    special group: Saint-Simonian socialists.

    -   It seems kind of confusing why socialist ideals would be
        "draped" around capitalistic efforts.

    -   Answer again in backwardness of country.

    -   Saint-Simon never against laissez-faire policies (under French
        conditions this laissez-faire ideology was altogether inadequate
        as a spiritual vehicle of an industrialization program (24))

    -   Stagnation of a country can't be overcome with promises of
        better allocation; nobody gets motivated by that

    -   Rather: faith is needed to motivate people into action, that
        "the golden age lies not behind but ahead of mankind" (24)

    -   Saint-Simon worked in his last year on a formulation of a new
        doctrine, on a new industrialized anthem, in which the happiness
        of all was tied to the laws of industry

    -   Similar changes in attitude and a gradual decline of
        backwardness found in Germany and in Russia

**Conclusion:**

-   Some main take-away key points:

    -   Pre-Industrial situation in a country necessary for
        understanding certain "spurtlike" decisions in the
        industrialization process

    -   Imitation of more advanced countries happens with a combination
        of indigenous factors in a country (strong significance of
        native elements)

    -   "As useful as the "lessons" of the 19th century may be" (27),
        they cannot be properly used without understanding the current
        economic climate (at time of writing the 20th century)

    -   Most developed and backward country comparisons these days
        happen with non-European countries

        -   The question of 'Preindustrial conditions vs. industrial
            potential' is answered rather pessimistically

        -   Yet the author asks, whether such conclusions "are unduly
            lacking in dynamic perspectives" (i.e. the Russian case)

        -   Nonetheless, The author acknowledges that due the fact that
            economic development has been *delayed for such a long time*
            in certain non-European countries, new obstacles have been
            created.

            -   Industrial progress expensive; medical progress cheap
                and easy to accomplish â†’ overpopulation ("industrial
                revolution may be defeated by Malthusian
                counterrevolutions" (28) *interesting take*

            -   Social tensions can arise as well and "assume sinister
                proportions" (i.e. the development of the Soviet Union,
                "the delayed industrial revolution was responsible for a
                political revolution in the course of which the power
                fell into the hands of a dictatorial government to which
                in the long run the vast majority of the population was
                opposed" (28); backwardness, rapid industrialization,
                ruthless exercise of dictatorial power + threat of war =
                perfect combination for maintaining USSR)

        -   The Soviet examples is - according to the author - a
            reminder of the dangers of economic backwardness in our day
            and age:

            -   "The road may lead from backwardness to dictatorship and
                from dictatorship to war"

            -   Add to this the bipolar world of imitating the Soviet
                "model" and the incorporation of others into the "soviet
                orbit"

        -   Therefore: economic backwardness is not just an issue the
            country itself, backwardness is also a problem of advanced
            countries

        -   Cannot be fixed or taken care of, if not acknowledged that
            every country is different in their backwardness and that
            there is no one-size-fits-all model
