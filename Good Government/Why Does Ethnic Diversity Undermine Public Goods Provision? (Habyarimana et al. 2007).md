# Long Summary

Habyarimana, James, Macartan Humphreys, Daniel Posner, and Jeremy
Weinstein. 2007. "Why Does Ethnic Diversity Undermine Public Goods
Provision?" *American Political Science Review* 101(4):709-725

*Most of this is directly from the text*

Habyarimana, et al. identify three families of mechanisms that link
diversity to public goods provisions. They term these as preferences,
technology, and strategy selection mechanisms. They run a series of
experimental games that permit them to compare the explanatory power of
distinct mechanisms within each of these three families. Results of
games conducted with a random sample of 300 subjects from a slum
neighborhood in Uganda suggests that successful public goods provision
in homogenous ethnic communities can be attributed to a strategy
selection mechanism: in similar settings, co-ethnics play cooperative
equilibria, whereas non-co-ethnics are more closely linked on social
networks and thus plausibly better able to support cooperation through
the threat of social sanctions. They find no evidence for prominent
preference mechanisms that emphasize the commonality of tastes within
ethnic groups or a greater degree of altruism toward co-ethnics, and
only weak evidence for technology mechanisms that focus on the impact of
shared ethnicity on the productivity of teams. \~ from the abstract

**Key Takeaways:**

-   ï»¿ A central question in political science is why some communities are
    able to generate high levels of public goods---low crime, good
    schools and health care, adequate sanitation, and clean drinking
    water---whereas others are not.

-   Ethnic diversity is an important source of variation in theses
    outcomes.

-   Emphasis is no on whether ethnic diversity undermines public goods
    provision, but why?

-   Authors find little evidence that ethnic group differences are
    associated with differences in either preferences for particular
    public goods or opinions about how they should be provided.

-   There is little empirical support in their data for the argument
    that ethnic groups possess correlated preferences over outcomes in
    Uganda.

-   Findings suggest that ethnically homogenous communities have an
    advantage in providing public goods because ethnic groups possess
    both norms and networks that facilitate the sanctioning of community
    members who fail to contribute to collective endeavors

-   Co-ethnics are more likely to cooperate than non-co-ethnics.

-   Community level ethnic diversity impedes the provision of public
    goods.

-   Co-ethnics cooperate because they adhere to in-group reciprocity
    norms (norms that are plausibly supported by expectations that
    non-contribution will be sanctioned and by an ethnic technology
    "findability" that facilitates sanctioning among co-ethnic
    pairings).

-   The positive impact of ethnic homogeneity on collective action stems
    directly from the ability of ethnic ties to induce more cooperative
    behavior among those individuals who would be least likely to
    cooperate.

-   They find no evidence that ethnic groups in Uganda have tastes for
    different kinds of public goods or that individuals exhibit greater
    degrees of altruism toward co-ethnics.

-   Co-ethnics are not significantly more effective at working together
    on joint tasks.
