# Long Summary


I tried to pare it down as much as possible while having it still make
sense. There is a shit ton of stuff in these chapters though. My
apologies.

**Ch 1-Definitions**

Nationalism

-   Primarily political principle holding that the political and
    national unit should be congruent.

-   A theory of political legitimacy requiring that ethnic boundaries
    shouldn't cut across political ones

-   Ethnic boundaries in a state shouldn't separate power-holders from
    the rest (the rulers and ruled should have the same nationality)

State

-   Weber's force monopoly + division of labor + enforcement of order

-   Nationalisms need states

-   3 eras of human history: pre-agrarian, agrarian, industrial. (we
    focus on the last 2)

-   The state becomes possible in agrarian society and inescapable in
    industrial society

**Ch 2-Culture in Agrarian Society**

-   The state emerged

    -   so did literacy + clerisy (clerisy is a specialized clerical
        class, it and literacy were enjoyed by only some)

-   Literacy: establishment of reasonably permanent, standardized script

-   Division of labor takes on 2 forms that affect the structure of the
    agro-literate polity

    -   Centralization of power

    -   Centralization of culture/cognition

-   Ruling strata stresses difference, ruling class horizontally
    stratified

-   Lay communities are laterally separated, inward turned. Cultural
    separation.

-   Nationalism wasn't around yet and it wouldn't have been accepted if
    it was. Culture and power remained separate.

    -   Clerisies at this point can't dominate/absorb society.

    -   The state in this era had 2 forms-local self-governing
        communities and large empires.

-   What happens when literacy and clerisy become universal and not the
    sole domain of a lucky few? High culture!

**Ch 3-Industrial Society**

-   Before the industrial age, languages of different activities were
    all their own autonomous systems (a la Peasants into Frenchmen)

-   With this age, we can now assume that language is set. References
    refer to one thing universally, one coherent world.

-   Unity of ideas connected to unity in community

-   This kind of society is ever growing and depends on cognitive and
    economic growth

Society of perpetual growth

-   Mobility -\> egalitarianism. Doesn't allow for entrenchment of class
    (or at least not to the written in stone separations of earlier
    eras)

-   There's less distance between different specializations and more
    reliance on mutually understood idioms than there was in agrarian
    society. Agrarian society really privileged specialists, there's
    less distance in industrial society.

    -   Specialization in industrial society rests on the foundation of
        unspecialized and standardized training.

    -   Education is respected as qualifications are standardized

    -   Modern society can no longer reproduce itself without an
        independent educational system (we are no longer training our
        spawns to take over our trades. Aw, shucks.)

-   So, education is enormously critical. (exo-socialization: sending
    your spawns to the state system to be educated)

    -   The minimum size for the viable political unit is tied to
        education

-   Monopoly on legit education \> monopoly on legit violence

    -   Nationalism's roots are in the pervasive social order, not in
        human nature

The Age of Universal High Culture

-   Again, education is absolutely critical to conferring
    usefulness/dignity on people

-   Educational infrastructure is too big for anyone other than the
    state to control

    -   The state is the only entity strong enough to perform this
        crucial function

-   Culture is now the necessary shared medium/system of communication

    -   It has to be a high culture. It has to be the one culture
        perpetuated in the given society.

    -   Effectiveness needs to be ensured by the state. Therefore, state
        and culture must be linked now.

**Ch 4-The Transition to the Age of Nationalism**

-   The weaknesses of nationalism are a key to understanding it

    -   Potential nationalisms (that don't get states) are abundant and
        they show that some groups feel the drive toward state/culture
        linkage more/less than others

    -   Nationalism, in principle, will happen, but no particular
        nationalism is fated to be successful

-   Nationalism is the consequence of new social organization based on
    deeply internalized, education dependent high cultures, each
    protected by its own state.

    -   This has become the norm in political legitimacy

    -   That nations are natural and state history starts with
        nationalist "awakenings" is a myth

**Ch 5- What is a Nation?**

-   Most existing groups are based on a mixture of willed adherence
    (loyalty) and extraneous incentives (hopes and fears). Not either
    alone.

-   Nations can only be defined in the context of the age of
    nationalism. Nationalism makes nations because nations aren't
    natural.

-   The cultural pieces invoked by nationalisms are often arbitrary
    historical inventions

    -   Nationalisms are deceptive and self deceptive. They sell myths
        about stuff like a pristine peasant past, viewing reality
        through a prism

-   However, nationalism itself isn't a contingent/accidental occurrence

    -   Nations worship themselves and that is a deeply rooted feeling

-   This is where his Ruritania/Megalomania thing comes in

    -   It's basically a parable about a society (Ruritania) that
        becomes a nation within the empire of Megalomania based on all
        the stuff discussed thus far. It's a nice descriptive read if
        y'all have time (p 62 of the book), but I won't rehash here.

**Ch 6-Social Entropy and Equality in Industrial Society**

-   The stability of the old agrarian structure was replaced by an
    internally random and fluid totality. This interchangeability of
    people was largely caused by standardized education. This is
    entropy.

Obstacles to Entropy

-   While most sense of sub-community has been eroded, some differences
    remain salient and socially/politically important.

-   Entropy resistant-those differences marked by attributes that never
    become evenly dispersed throughout the society.

    -   Those who have the trait have too many/too few advantages

    -   Those at the bottom experience prejudice and assimilation isn't
        always possible

    -   Latent political tension is acute and can become actual (he
        talks a bit about faiths here as associated with discontent and
        possible breakoffs into nations-I'm totally lost on this
        argument)

-   High cultures that survive the transition to industrialization are
    the hallmark of the nation they form. They become "secularized"

-   Colonization doesn't necessarily conform to this model.
