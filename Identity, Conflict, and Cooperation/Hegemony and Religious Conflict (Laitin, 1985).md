# Long Summary


Laitin (1985)

-   Question: What explains variation in societal cleavages across
    cases?

-   Answer: "When a central administration has the motivation and power
    to structure the pattern of political group formation in society,"
    it acts as a hegemon and creates divisions that best suit their
    interests (286-287)

    -   Laitin says that this hegemon can either be internal or external

<!-- -->

-   Existing theories (primordial and rational-choice) are not fully
    explanatory

-   Case study: Yoruba (west African - present-day Nigeria (mostly))

    -   Why did Yoruba groups not divide along religious lines, but
        instead based on tribe/ancestral city?

<!-- -->

-   Very little sociocultural difference between Yoruba of different
    ancestral cities, but the myth of common descent and "othering" of
    other cities is perpetuated in each city

-   Much more obvious cleavage would be along religious lines - equal
    parts Christian and Muslim, with Christians seeing benefits relative
    to Muslims in education, finances, politics, etc.

    -   However, religious difference is not operationalized for
        societal cleavage - division is downplayed by Yorubas, who say
        religious difference is not politicized because of
        "cross-cutting family ties" (295)

    -   Political parties have not tried to bifurcate polity along
        religious lines

<!-- -->

-   Problem summarized very nicely on p.299: "Although the social
    significance of religious differentiation among the Yoruba has
    increased in the past century, its political manifestations have
    been weak. Meanwhile, the relative social significance of the
    ancestral city has declined markedly in the past century, yet its
    political centrality persists."

-   Essentially, Laitin's argument is that the British colonizers
    propped up certain elites based on ancestral city-belonging. These
    elites had a historical basis in Yoruba society, but declining
    resources and power. By propping them up, the hegemon (Britain)
    could support these elites in maintaining and expanding power, while
    also controlling them by creating a structure of reliance.
