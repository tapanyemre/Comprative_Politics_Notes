# Long Summary


Laitin, David. 2007. *Nations, States and Violence*. Oxford and New
York: Oxford University Press. [Chapters 1-3]{.underline}

*Most of this is directly from the text*

**Chapter 1: The Pandemonium of Nations**

This chapter first points to a conventional wisdom that nationalism is
dangerous. The historical and contemporary evidence showing links
between nationalism and violence is great. Quantitative data, however,
undermines confidence in theories purporting to show that national
aspirations, differences, or demographics are systematically associate
with communal violence or civil war. What explains this disconnect?

-   Selection bias

-   The listening too earnestly to the accounts of combatants

-   The way we think about ethnicity and nationalism -- namely, that
    they are built on a rock solid 'primordial' foundation -- makes
    these attachments seem a threat to the give and take of democratic
    life

**Key Takeaways:**

-   ï»¿ Linking an insurgency to a nationalist cause helps to sustain that
    insurgency

-   Grievances are relevant. They are usually motivating factors for
    violent mobilization

-   But ethnic grievances are commonly felt and latent; the factors that
    make these grievances vital and manifest differentiate the violent
    from the nonviolent cases.

-   There are four routes leading national and ethnic groups to violence
    either against their state or against ethnic/national others:
    irredentism, secession, sons-of-the-soil, and communalism

-   The first three routes are justified by challengers to the status
    quo with a view that all nations merit their own states.

-   Irredentism: Interstate violence has followed when a nation has a
    state of its own but seeks to redeem territory occupied by fellow
    nationals living in a neighboring state

-   Secession: Intrastate violence has followed from the inverse of
    irredentist issue-here when a nation is not larger but rather
    smaller than the state, and it self-appointed representatives seek
    to have a state of their own (Megalomania vs. Ruritania)

-   Irredentism Combined with Secession: Irredentism combined with
    secession (triadic configuration) is especially dangerous. Three
    actors (national, minorities, nationalizing states, and external
    national homelands). Cites the start of WWII with Hitler invading
    the Sudetenland.

-   Sons-of-the-Soil: movements have been violent and reflect national
    conflicts. Dominant population lives in an overpopulated core zone,
    with a minority population in an impoverished dry zone on the
    periphery. State suddenly invests in schemes to enrich the formerly
    dry zone. The state wins support from its core constituency by
    inducing them to migrate as homesteaders in newly irrigated lands.
    These migrations induce resentment by the indigenous populations of
    the region; but when the demographic balance in the dry region
    shifts in favor of the dominant nationality group of the country,
    the indigenous population sees this as a loss of their historic
    homeland. This drives the outraged minority into the hills as
    guerrilla bands organized to reclaim their homeland.

-   Pogroms and Communal Warfare: When quasi-organized militias of one
    ethnic group attack civilians (in which the attacks are called
    pogroms) and/or militias (in which the attacks and counterattacks
    are called communal warfare) from another ethnic group that is an
    instigator, a passive observer that supports the attackers by not
    sending in the police, or a third party seeking to negotiate a
    truce.

**Chapter 2: National Cascades**

Cite Renan's definition of a nation: cultures are not given to people by
nature, but rather are constructed through collective action and
reinforced through the manipulation of collective consciousness. People
choose their national myths. This chapter addresses how individuals
agree on the 'general will' Rousseau cited in his work, *The Social
Contract*.

**Key Takeaways:**

-   Nations are the result of the choices made by their prospective
    members

-   Laitin uses language as a proxy for national identity

-   A nation can be defined as a population with a coordinated set of
    beliefs about their cultural identities (i.e. the salient cultural
    dimension, their category on that dimension, and the attributes
    qualifying people for membership in that category) whose
    representatives claim ownership of a state (or at least an
    autonomous region within a state) for them by dint of that
    coordination either through separation, or amalgamation, or return

-   The nation is a product of cultural coordination and the claim to
    statehood or political autonomy for the population that successfully
    coordinates

-   Regional revivals do not succeed only with a majority sentiment in
    their favor; they require for success the expectation of all
    individuals that all other individuals expect the revival to succeed
    and have conditioned their behavior (most importantly, in where to
    send children to school) on that expectation

-   People do not vote for their nationality as they do for a set of
    political alternatives because the principal goal in this sort of
    election is not to win, but to choose the national identity that
    most others in one's community are likely to choose.

-   When it comes to national identities, we are not in competition with
    our neighbors but in coordination with them.

-   The tipping model illustrates both the sense of permanence and the
    fragility of national identifications.

-   The primoradial image of society, where class is dynamic due to
    opportunities for social mobility while nationality is static
    without any expectations of cultural mobility, is flawed.

**Chapter 3: The Cultural Foundation of Nationalism**

Do national lack any cultural content? This chapter intends to answer
this question. From two perspectives, one that is consistent with the
coordination approach to nationality, an equilibrium notion of culture
is proposed. Here culture is seen as a resource enabling collective
action. Yet from a second perspective, another research tradition shows
how the transmission of culture sustains distinct norms, beliefs, and
even worldviews. Reconciling these two faces of culture is essential for
any understanding of how cultures (and nations) coordinate and what they
coordinate on.

**Key Takeaways:**

-   A cultural equilibrium exists when members of a cultural group have
    overriding incentives in a range of circumstances to behave in the
    manner prescribed by their culture

-   Culture can be subject to analysis, that is to say, broken down into
    its component parts

-   Cultural analysis can provide clear and simple answers to big
    questions

-   Languages (and other cultural categories) reproduce practices that
    reflect common knowledge beliefs and points of concern

-   On the one face, culture provides symbolic resources that permit
    coordination and control; on the other face, culture embeds common
    knowledge beliefs that are transmitted across generations

-   Languages embed within them appropriate ways to address conflictual
    issues

-   Nations that are commensurate with state boundaries have populations
    that share common knowledge and points of conern
