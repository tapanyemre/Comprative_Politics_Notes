# Long Summary



James Scott, Moral Economy of the Peasant

PhD in pols from Yale, teaches at Yale, lives in Durham CT and raises
sheep

Is apparently still alive

\*This might be one of the worst-organized book chapters I've ever read.
I got the gist, but he didn't make it easy.

**Ch 7 Revolt, Survival, and Repression**

-   The growing exploitation of peasantry may be a necessary cause of
    rebellion, but it's not a sufficient cause

-   Rebellion is one of the least likely consequences of exploitation

-   This chapter suggests a few conditions that, when combined with
    exploitation:

    -   Increase likelihood of peasant rebellion

    -   Decrease possibility of rebellion

-   Central issues:

    -   Structural context of revolt

    -   Paths of survival and nonrevolt

    -   Anatomy of repression

-   What's needed for a rebellion

    -   An increase in exploitation that touches many peasants
        similarly, is sudden, that threatens existing subsistence
        arrangements. The scope and the suddenness of the shock is
        important.

-   He's looking at southeast Asia in the early 20th century

**The Structural Context of a Rebellion**

-   Major developments in the agrarian system reduced subsistence margin
    of the peasantry

-   The more brittle agrarian structure was caused by 3 forces

    -   Demographic change

    -   Production for the market

    -   Growth of the state and its coercive/extractive functions

-   The nature of collective shocks

    -   Some peasants were more vulnerable than others, measured in real
        income

**Nonrebellious adaptation-4 forms (paths of survival)**

-   Reliance on local forms of self help

-   Reliance on the non-peasant sector of the economy

-   Reliance on state supported patronage and assistance

-   Reliance on religious oppositionist structures of protection and
    assistance

**Nonrevolt and the question of false consciousness**

-   Deciding whether to rebel may be more of a rational choice (modern
    armies and weaponry are fucking scary, guys)

-   Rebellion may be a last resort-a final gesture of misery

-   Memory of past repressions can have a chilling effect

-   Looking at peasant culture is an incomplete measure of peasants'
    acceptance or rejection of the social order
