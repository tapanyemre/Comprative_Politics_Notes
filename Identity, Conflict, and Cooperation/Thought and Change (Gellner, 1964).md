# Long Summary

(The quote is from this chapter, but Ernie doesn't look amused)

(also, all aboard Austin's trend train of author pics)

Main Points:

-   nations are invented but the feelings of unity and division they
    invoke now are real.

-   Language is very important in educating the citizenry and creating
    the nation

-   What the social construct of nationalism has become is both unifying
    and divisive along lines of pre-existing differences

**Cold Reason Against the Dark Gods**

-   Liberalism and Marxism both (wrongly) assumed nationalism would
    decline-how could it coexist with reason/enlightenment/international
    trade?

-   Gellner doesn't buy the argument that man is the prey of dark gods,
    and ethnic and territorial loyalty come with being part of that
    prey.

**The Contingency of Nationalism**

-   The mistake of both friends and enemies of nationalism is assuming
    that it's natural

    -   The Doctrine of Nationalism tells this story in 3 parts:

        -   philosophical/anthro-nationalism is natural like having a
            nose is natural. Belonging to a nation is a central part of
            man's being

        -   Psychological-people want to live with people of the same
            nationality and resent being ruled by those of another one

        -   Evaluative-belief that the first 2 conditions are correct

-   The truth-there's nothing universal or natural about possessing a
    nationality.

    -   That nationality matters politically is a historical oddity.

    -   However, contemporary social conditions make nationalism feel
        natural

        -   We have to separate the natural argument from the social
            roots

**Structure and Culture**

-   Primitive societies generally had highly developed cultures with no
    incompatibility between structure and culture

    -   Relied on implied communication and context, language didn't
        matter

    -   Modern societies-communication becomes important because context
        is unfamiliar

-   There is an inverse relationship between structure and culture-the
    erosion of structure leads to the importance of culture (which
    becomes nationality)

**End as a Man**

-   Traditionally, villages (or village sized units) were all-important.
    They were self contained and produced "little Bedouins" (or
    whatever).

-   Village sized units are no longer competent to produce fully
    competent people. Now, they create potential citizens.

-   Making a person now means taking that potential and adding more
    resources. Notably, education, to which common language is critical.
    Speaking the same language at school and at home becomes important.

-   Literacy is critical for full citizenship. It takes a nation-sized
    educational system to produce full citizens, making nation-sized
    units the minimum political units.

-   Semi-skilled workers built in this way are traditionally most useful
    at home, their skills don't translate to other places the same way
    intelligentsia's can

-   SO, nationalist loyalty comes from necessity more than
    ideology/mythology

-   Modern loyalties are centered on political units whose boundaries
    are defined by the language of an educational system.

    -   This is a partial explanation for nationalism

    -   If this is the unifying part of nationalism, we also need to
        look at the divisive part.

Why should some people within new national territory opt for citizenship
in another nation?

-   The uneven impact of industrialization/modernization in new nations
    creates cleavages, providing the misery needed for redrawing
    political loyalties.

    -   Advanced societies don't want to integrate non-advanced workers

    -   When new workers are similar to existing workers, other
        exclusions (race, etc) are drawn on to exclude them

        -   So, nations are invented but they do rely on real
            differences

There are 2 prongs of nationalism, both necessary for a successful
nationalist movement

-   Discontent proles who may not benefit as much when the nation is
    formed

-   Intelligentsia who do benefit because they'll have a monopoly on
    selling their services in new nation

A couple last notes:

-   He separates nationalism proper (citizenship through education and
    language) from more generic group loyalties. This lets it be a
    modern phenomenon

-   The world only has space for so many nations to be created from a
    lot of nationalisms

    -   Nationalism is arbitrary, but it's powerful. There are other
        powerful forces that can overpower it

-   He also half-makes an argument at the very end that the cultural
    diversification encouraged by nationalism is a protection against
    tyranny. I need more information on this.
