Political Cultures: Measuring Values Heterogeneity Lisa Blaydes\* Justin
Grimmer (2018).

Introduction

1)  Political culture has been described as one of the few
    "mega-concepts\" in the social science.

Huntington (1996) advocated for the perspective that the world should be
viewed as being divided into cultural blocs\" where regional and
religious identity translate into common civilizational cultures.
Quantitative studies of political culture have explored national
cultures as well as diversity of cultural perspectives within countries. There are at least three significant trends in efforts to define culture.

A.  a conceptualization of culture that focuses on meaning-making
    through rhetoric and symbolic displays.

B.  Second stream in the literature draws inspiration from game
    theoretic depictions of coordination dilemmas, tipping processes and
    behavior influenced by lack of complete information. Greif
    (1994, 915) defines culture as beliefs that capture individual\'s
    expectations with respect to actions that others will take in
    various contingencies.

C.  Wildavsky (1987, 3) defines political culture as shared values
    legitimating social relations. This definition emphasizes value
    consensus and the existence of core belief clusters. Scholars
    working in this tradition, typically employ the results of
    large-scale public opinion polls to examine cross-national variation
    in stated belief patterns. We adopt a working definition of
    political culture which focuses on aggregation of stated beliefs.
    This paper employs this approach.

Model

1)  Model: Method Bayesian hierarchical model, 57 countries, World Value
    Survey

> Inglehart (1997) measures a single political culture in each country.
> Seligson (2002) responds, arguing that such an approach discards
> individual-level responses unnecessarily, ignoring within-country
> variation. Our statistical model accommodates both perspectives. Like
> Inglehart (1997), we produce estimates at the country level. And like
> Seligson (2002), we retain interesting heterogeneity within each
> country.

Result

1)  Our results suggest that there exist certain universal values that
    are shared by the vast majority of respondents across countries and
    cultures. Respondents almost universally agree that family is
    important and, seek a greater emphasis on family in their lives.
    Although cultures differ in their tolerance for certain undesirable
    types in their immediate vicinity, very few people in the global
    sample and it acceptable to be neighbors with drug addicts or heavy
    drinkers. Finally, respondents tend to agree that they need to set
    their own goals in life and, agree that it is important to be
    oneself than to follow others. There is, however, variation in the
    extent to which respondents agree with that sentiment.

2)  They also categorized results in 7 subtypes.

<!-- -->

A)  Japan, Germany, Russia: care for job, hardworking, Not care for
    leisure, belief, politics, technology

B)  US, Canada, UK, Latin American Countries: care for hardworking,
    technology, authority, religion

Tolerance to neighbor with HIV.

C)  Some Islamic countries: Category C respondents are distinctive for
    their misogynistic responses relative to other categories, believing
    that jobs should be reserved for men, being a housewife is fullling,
    men make better political leaders and so on. Category 3 respondents
    are uncritically positive toward science, technology and
    competition.

D)  Some people in India: Do not Know. Maybe because 1. They do not
    answer without knowledge, 2. Not comfortable to answer this type of
    surveys.

E)  Hong Kong, Thailand, East Asia and Some people in USA: While many
    respondents around the world agreed strongly that it was important
    to be oneself this was less so the case for category E respondents.
    Category E respondents are less likely to say that helping others is
    important to them; on average, they care less about the environment.

F)  Category F respondents are the modal respondent type in Indonesia,
    Iran and Turkey but also common in Georgia, Rwanda, Ghana and
    Vietnam. Close to categories C but less misogynistic.

G)  Category G respondents cPostmaterialist values. Representative
    countries for this category include the Scandinavian countries
    (which are almost entirely of this type), New Zealand as well as
    sizable populations within the United States, France, Britain and
    Germany.

3)  In some countries, there is a great deal of homogeneity over type
    (Figure 2). Citizens of Hong Kong, for instance, are almost
    universally category 5 respondents; Swedes fall predominantly into
    category G; Iraqis are almost universally category C. Latin American
    countries tend to be fairly homogeneously with large percentages of
    their citizens identifying to category B. At the other end of the
    spectrum, countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe, Africa and
    some the world\'s largest states, Russia, China and India all
    exhibit high levels of cultural fractionalization.

4)  To what extent do these cultural categories match up to scholarly
    conceptualizations of differences between world cultures?
    Huntington (1996) argues that the world can be divided into a series
    of world civilizations (i.e., Western, Orthodox, African, Latin
    American, Islamic, Buddhist, etc). From a cultural values
    perspective, Huntington\'s typology only holds up in a very limited
    way and not in the manner he predicted. One dimension on which
    Huntington (1996) may enjoy some support relates to the distance
    between what might be called Western values and the cultural values
    of Muslim-majority societies. Although there is considerable
    diversity within the Islamic world, the world cultures that appear
    to be most dissimilar are C typically found of Egypt, Iraq and
    Jordan and G typically found in Finland, Sweden and, to a lesser
    degree, the United States.

Conclusion

1)  One can imagine a set of initial cultural conditions created, in
    part, as a result of geographical factors (Mahoney). Our approach
    builds on a literature which suggests that political cultures are
    multifaceted and do not necessarily overlap, spatially, with
    national borders (Nesbitt-Larking, 1992,These finndings are
    consistent with Silver and Dowley (2000) who and nd that
    within-country variation across ethnic groups often exceeds
    variation in attitudes across countries, suggesting that countries
    may not be the best units of analysis for exploring questions of
    political culture.
