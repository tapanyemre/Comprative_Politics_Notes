# Long Summary

**Benedict Anderson, "Imagined Communities" (1983)**

(I'm hopping on the trend that Austin started)

[Chapter 1]{.underline}

-   Aim of book: provide alternative to Marxism to explain emergence and
    relevance of nationalism

-   Nationalism is a cultural artifact

<!-- -->

-   Three paradoxes:

    a.  Nationalism as a phenomenon is new, but nations are anchored in
        antiquity by those who perpetuate them

    b.  Formal universality of nationalism vs. its particularity when it
        is manifested

    c.  Political power of nationalism vs. philosophical incoherence
        (there has never been a nationalist philosopher as there has
        been for other isms)

<!-- -->

-   Definition of "nation": "an imagined political community \-- and
    imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign." (6)

    -   Imagined because members of a nation will never know all other
        members, but will still identify closely with them.

    -   Limited because even the biggest nationalism will not include
        all people (always an us vs. them)

    -   Community - always seen as a "deep, horizontal comradeship"
        regardless of inequality and exploitation within

[Chapter 2]{.underline}

-   What made nationalism possible? Three factors set the stage: decline
    of religious community, decline of dynastic realm, new conceptions
    of time

<!-- -->

-   Decline of religious community

    -   Religion provided meaning to life and death

    -   Exploration of non-European world and increased use of
        vernacular at the expense of "sacred" languages like Latin led
        to decline of religious communities

    -   In short, the fall of "script-language" that was associated with
        religious truth led to a fall in the salience of that religious
        truth itself (Reformation, etc.)

<!-- -->

-   Decline of dynastic realm

    -   Monarchies with territories defined by the center, not the
        borders

    -   Joining of diverse populations over often large areas of land

    -   Began its decline in 17th century

<!-- -->

-   "Apprehensions of time"

    -   Understanding of time changed

    -   In earlier ages, no difference between biblical events and
        things that happened yesterday - "cosmology and history were
        indistinguishable" (36)

    -   More recently (in large part due to novels and newspapers),
        events understood in terms of time, simultaneity, etc.

<!-- -->

-   When these declined/changed, a new means to "link fraternity, power,
    and time" was needed. Print-capitalism allowed people to consider
    their lives and relate themselves to others.

[Chapter 3]{.underline}

-   Temporal convergence of capitalism with print technology created the
    basis for establishing imagined connections between and among
    people.

-   When Latin market was saturated (about 150 years), printers began to
    make books in local vernaculars. Obviously not all patois got a
    print treatment, but people began to see that their languages were
    closely connected to others when printed, even if they couldn't
    understand each other's speech.

-   The selection of which vernacular to print led to the deaths of some
    dialects.

-   Laid basis for national identity by:

    -   Awareness of others with similar backgrounds (see above)

    -   Created fixity of language that allowed future nationalists to
        connect national languages to antiquity

    -   Created "languages of power" that were closest to the printed
        languages and thus received cultural superiority

-   At the time, this was an accidental process. More recently, it has
    been exploited by governments and nationalists

[Chapter 4]{.underline}

-   But not all national identities are formulated around common
    language

-   In Americas, two features were distinct from European nationalism

    -   The intelligentsia who formed the national ethos spoke the same
        language as the colonial centers

    -   These national identities did not begin with peasants - often,
        independence movements were spurred on by fear of lower class
        uprisings - landowners and upper classes formed the national
        identity

-   Creoles, even those who were phenotypically indistinguishable from
    people living in the imperial centers, were not considered Spanish,
    English, etc. Similarly, they were not considered members of the
    place in which they were born/lived.

-   Liberalism and the Enlightenment provided the language used by
    "creole pioneers," often through print, to establish a sense of
    belonging as well as a conceptualization of the "other" that would
    allow for national identity to form

[Chapter 5]{.underline}

-   Nationalist movements in 18th century Europe essentially had a
    blueprint from the creole pioneers discussed in Chapter 4 (this
    became even more true after the French Revolution)

-   Ideas of revolutionaries/nationalists, including examinations of why
    they succeeded in the Americas (and eventually in France) were
    printed and disseminated

-   Domination of vernaculars in print allowed for cohesion among
    classes

[Chapter 6]{.underline}

-   "Official nationalism" - a creation of dynastic centers to willingly
    merge nation with empire - was a direct reaction to European
    national movements

-   These would be impossible without being preceded by
    linguistic-nationalist movements described in C4+5

-   When this happened in imperial colonies, the subjects of the empire
    were to be Anglicized, Japanified, etc., but they could never really
    be English/Japanese/etc., and thus were looked down on by those at
    the core

    -   This was not just because of racism (though that was certainly
        present), but it was also in order to keep control as
        nationalisms were emerging in these colonies - "conjuring trick"
        (111)

-   Motivation of all official nationalism is to unite in order to
    consolidate rule (make subjects/citizens feel connected to state)

[Chapter 7]{.underline}

-   "Last wave" of nationalism occurred mostly in former colonies in
    response to imperial capitalism post-WW2

-   The very tactics that were used in official nationalism-creation led
    to the demise of colonial rule, as imperial subjects were subjected
    to nationalist language and coopted the ideas to envision themselves
    as nationals. The final paragraph of this chapter is a great
    summary:

    -   "As bilingual intelligentsias, however, and above all as
        early-twentieth century intelligentsias, they had access, inside
        the classroom and outside, to models of nation, nation-ness, and
        nationalism distilled from the turbulent chaotic experiences of
        more than a century of American and European history. These
        models, in turn, helped to give shape to a thousand inchoate
        dreams. In varying combinations, the lessons of creole,
        vernacular and official nationalism were copied, adapted, and
        improved upon. Finally, as with increasing speed capitalism
        transformed the means of physical and intellectual
        communication, the intelligentsias found ways to bypass print in
        propogating the imagined community, not merely to illiterate
        masses, but even to literate masses reading different
        languages." (140)
