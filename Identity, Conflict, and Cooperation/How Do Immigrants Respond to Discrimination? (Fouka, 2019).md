# Long Summary


Fouka (2019)

*\*\*\*\*\*I'm keeping this short because I think a more detailed
description would get bogged down in unnecessary details and statistics.
This is the main argument, and there's really no additional pieces to
the argument.\*\*\*\*\**

**Main question**: Do discriminated groups increase assimilation
attempts in order to avoid discriminationa, or do they retreat into
their own communities?

**Answer**: Yes. Germans Americanized their names (and gave less
distinctly-German names to their children) and filed for US citizenship
in the face of discrimination during World War 1. This trend was higher
in states with higher levels of anti-German sentiment,.

**Methods**: Analyzed naming patterns and petitions for naturalization,
coded and used quantitative methods to show a positive relationship
between anti-German sentiment and assimilation efforts.

**What did it add to scholarship?**: The author says that previous
articles did not address the direct cause of discrimination. Fouka
remedies this by identifying an exogenous change (WW1) that led to
discrimination

**DV**: frequency and intensity of assimilation attempts

**IV**: levels of anti-immigrant sentiment

-   Measured by voting patterns and incidents of violence against
    Germans

Basically:

**Exogenous Change → Discrimination → Assimilation**
