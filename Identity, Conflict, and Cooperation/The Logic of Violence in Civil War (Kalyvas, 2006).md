# Long Summary


**Kalyvas, Stathis N. 2006. *The Logic of Violence in Civil War ***

I insanely had a hard time to grasp this book because it is supposed to
mainly talk about Greek around 1940s but uses lots of international
example, US-Iraq, China, Japan, Guatemala from introduction to, up until
chapter 6-7 and these examples for comparison did not help me to
understand things. Least enjoyable in this class Oh, my god.

**Introduction and Chapter 7**

**Summary**

Kalyvas generally saying that violence most likely occurs when control
of the territory is somewhat more strongly by either insurgent group or
nation (Zone 2 and 4). When the control over the territory is fully
achieved by either of one player (Zone 1 and 5), it would be hard to
turn the rule over via violence. Also, territories where both players
equally control over (Zone 3), is also less likely to experience
violence because clashing the opponent which holds same amount of power
is costly to conquer. There seem some villages are outlier for this
model, but Kalyvas analysis largely support his likelihood of violence.
Historical experience(some territory experienced long period of being
Zone 3 and shifted to Zone 2 or 4) of the village may reduce the
likelihood of violence in comparison with other village categorized as
Zone 2 or 4. Kalybas analyzed the model of violence from
rational/instrumental behavior but also acknowledge historical
experience/institution and personal grudges create some outliers but
overall model seems correct as provided.

**Role of Informant/ Denounce and Defect**

Kalybas explained the importance of the role of informant who provide
information of local denouncer with territorial controller. This explain
the up and down of his model.
