# Long Summary
#### Chapter 1

""

(Jenny: chapter 1 in book)

-   Collective action occurs all the time

-   Movements have a collective action problem, but it is social:
    coordination of population into a common action.

-   Based on anecdote about 1993 march in Washington protesting for gays
    and lesbians to be allowed to serve in the military, the author
    defines three basic questions of social movement theory:

    -   1\) Why do people act collectively in the face of many reasons
        why they shouldn't?

    -   2\) Why do they so act when they do?

    -   3\) What are the outcomes of collective action?

-   The author argues: Movements depend on their external environments
    (and especially political opportunities) to coordinate and sustain
    collective action.

<!-- -->

-   First, though, a Marxist theorist review (providing collective
    context of movements)

    -   Marx (and Engels) saw the problem of collective action rooted in
        social structures

        -   Marx: people will engage in collective action when their
            social class is in fully developed contradiction with its
            antagonists (11)

        -   Why people didn't revolt even though they should, Marx
            deemed a problem of "false consciousness" which should be
            remedied through lengthy period of time of working side by
            side with your fellow exploited man

        -   Never really 'solved' the problem of the intricacies of the
            workers essentially being involved in the capitalist
            structure

    -   Lenin and Gramsci had clear understanding of the role of
        political opportunities, organization and culture in producing
        collective action

        -   Lenin proposed a solution of elite of professional
            revolutionaries (a vanguard to guide them all)

        -   Organization as solution to the collective action problem
            (party)

        -   Masses needing a direction

        -   Gramsci added to Lenin's solution two theorem

            -   1\) a fundamental task of the revolutionary party was to
                create a historic bloc of forces around the working
                class (12)

            -   2\) could only occur if a cadre of "organic
                intellectuals" developed from within the working class
                to complement the traditional intellectuals in the party

                -   Added need for consensus, not just top down
                    vanguard-ism

                -   Need for multiple levels of leadership

<!-- -->

-   Modern theory of social movements is based on all three elements
    that these authors bring together (Marx movement mobilization,
    Lenin's action through organization, and Gramsci's consensus among
    the mobilized)

    -   Changes in so far:

        -   Less centralized, more recognition of importance of looser
            structures

        -   Instead of focusing on collective intellectuals (ala
            Gramsci), focus is more on broaders, less controllable
            cultural frames

        -   Focus more on structural theory of political opportunities

*Lit review of notable authors on collective action (which we are also
reading for this week, so I will keep it brief):*

1)  Mancur Olson (1965):

    a.  Importance of non material incentives

    b.  Theory starts and ends with the individual

    c.  Problem of collective action is aggregative (how to involve as
        high a proportion of a group as possible on behalf of its
        collective good)

    d.  Size of group important

        i.  In large groups, important members have incentive to take on
            leadership

            1.  The larger the group the more people prefer to free ride

        ii. Small group: individuals and collective good closely
            associated

        iii. Solution for large groups: constraints on members or
             provide selective incentives

    e.  Collective action has an organizational solution

2)  John McCarthy, Mayer Zald (1973)

    a.  Responding to Olson, agreeing that his theory applies to
        movements

    b.  Addition though: the greater the affluence and widespread
        organizational skills available in modern society provide
        organizers with resources with which to mobilize people

    c.  Organizers not just those with biggest grievances, but those who
        are considered "professional movement entrepreneurs" → Social
        Movement Organizations (SMO)

3\) the author positions themselves and argues that Olson was primarily
concerned with interest groups, not social movements

-   An individual's affiliation with a social movement must not be
    necessarily based in marginal utility (many reasons why people join
    a movement)

-   While the proportion of members who participate in collective action
    is critical to measure the strength of the economic association,
    there are no clear cut size rules for movements; membership is often
    in formation as the movement becomes visible

-   That relationship between leaders and followers that Olson
    envisioned, is sometimes not present in social movements

-   The author argues that, i.e. the gay march on Washington wasn't
    about overcoming a free rider problem (ala Olson), it was more about
    the social component (coordinating, sustaining, and giving meaning
    to a collective action)

*The Social in Social Movements:*

-   Not a group, lacks compulsory coordination (unlike a firm for
    instance)

-   Cannot solve its collective action problem through internalization

-   They rely on external resources (opportunities, conventions,
    understandings and social networks → to coordinate and sustain
    collective action

-   Most important opportunities are in the changes in the structure of
    political opportunity

1)  Political Opportunity Structure:

    a.  People join in social movements in response to political
        opportunities and then create new ones through collective action

    b.  When therefore goes a long way in explaining the why

    c.  Political opportunity translates the potential for movement into
        mobilization

    d.  Political opportunity structure (18): consistent - but not
        necessarily formal, permanent, or national - dimensions of the
        political environment which either encourage or discourage
        people from using collective action

        i.  Emphasizes resources external to the group (unlike money or
            power) that can be taken advantage of

    e.  Most salient changes: opening up of access of power, from shifts
        in ruling alignments, from the availability of influential
        allies and from the cleavages within and among elites (18)

2)  Contention by convention:

    a.  Anthropologist Kertzer: collective action not born out of
        organizers' heads but is culturally inscribed and
        communicated (18) → socialization

    b.  Particular groups have particular histories (memories) of
        collective actions

        i.  Workers

        ii. Parisians

        iii. Peasants

    c.  People are drawn to well known forms of collective action

    d.  Because movements lack selective incentives/constraints, the
        leadership has creative function in collective action →
        inventing, adapting, combining various forms of collective
        action to stimulate support from people who otherwise might stay
        home

    e.  Collective action shouldn't be just viewed as a cost, it can be
        a benefit for people

    f.  Movements need to achieve a careful balance between not
        appearing stronger than they are and not to be so repetitive in
        their convention that they are boring and cannot incite support

3)  Mobilizing Structures:

    a.  Once these political opportunities appear, how is collective
        action diffused, coordinated, and sustained? (21)

        i.  The social

            1.  Social networks, institutions in which collective action
                activated and sustained

            2.  Names several types of laboratory and real-world
                research illustrating the importance of supporting group
                environment stimulates individuals into action

            3.  I.e. Black Churches as base for Civil rights movement

            4.  The mobilizing of pre-existing social networks lowers
                the social transaction costs of mounting demonstrations
                and it holds participants together even after enthusiasm
                of peak of confrontation is over (22)

4)  Consensus mobilization:

    a.  Movement depends also on collective action frames that justify,
        dignify, and animate collective action (22)

    b.  Grievances are shaped into broader claims in a process of
        purposive "framing work" (23)

    c.  Framing happening not just within the movement, but also outside
        (i.e. media), which can complicate things

    d.  Movements possess little cultural power to exude some kind of
        shaping power over the media

Dynamic of Movement:

-   Difference between power to start something, and power to actually
    sustain it

-   The political opportunities that allowed for one social movement to
    flourish also allowed others to create something (complimentary,
    hostile, opposing, etc.)

-   If collective action succeeds, opportunities produce broader
    movement cycles, which spread from the movement activists to
    ordinary interest groups and citizens and then eventually bring in
    the state (24)

    -   At extreme end of spectrum: cycles of protests give rise to
        revolutions

        -   In revolutions multiple centers of sovereignty are created,
            turning conflict between challengers and members of the
            policy into a struggle for power (from Tilly) (25)

-   While social movements conceive themselves as outside of traditional
    structures, eventually their collective action will bring them into
    the reach of the state (can even begin to mimic structures they
    actually oppose)

-   Studying their outcomes not that interesting

-   Movements also need to be understood as a part of the national
    struggle for power (26)

-   It is far easier for movements to mount collective action than to
    sustain it due to that fact that they get their support from
    external resources to lower their social transaction costs (26)


**States and Social Movements** 

#### Chapter 4

*Intro:*

-   Tocqueville:

    -   State centralization produced differences in the opportunity
        structure of social movements → of which movements take
        advantage of

    -   Not all opportunities the same or effective the same but
        centralization plays a key role

    -   Coming of the national state coincided with the birth of
        national movements (62)

*Centralization and Exceptionalism (according to Tocqueville):*

-   Centralization of the state in France, denuded the aristocracy, no
    more buffer between state and society, narrow individualism
    practiced, jealousy, sporadic and uncontrollable mobilization →
    French Revolution

-   In the US, no strong state had emerged; churches, local assemblies
    and interest groups protected against state expansion

    -   "With its weak state and its flourishing associations, American
        democracy could avoid the extremes of egalitarianism and statist
        despotism that France was suffering"(64)

-   Tocqueville was exaggerating both extremes

-   State-building in both instances provided opportunity for social
    movements (65)

*State building and collective action:*

-   Even before French Revolution, states were expanding their powers
    and their abilities to structure relations between citizens and
    their rulers

-   Expanding states made war, requiring an infrastructure that could
    sustain war making (growth of industry and commerce, which impacted
    other parts of life)

-   Not intended to support social mobilization

    -   But they provided means of mass-communication

    -   Created class of men experienced in public affairs

    -   And led to financial exaction of people who were not always
        willing to pay them

    -   States also had to create structures that would allow relations
        among groups, meaning a legal framework for associations had to
        be created

-   Framework for new identities to emerge was set

-   Three basic policies (waging war, collecting taxes, provisioning
    food) were part of struggle waged by expanding states to assure and
    expand their power (66)

    -   Initially as pressures to penetrate citizenry, but also allowed
        at the same time for organizations to emerge with countering
        claims

1)  War and movement in Britain:

    a.  Formation of party system and opportunities for social movement
        formation were advanced by most aggressive activity for British
        state: colonization and waging war

    b.  Reform movement of 18th century because of upsets in the
        colonies (US), revolutionary war

    c.  Began in Yorkshire (far from London) as cost of war increased
        and probability of win decreased, Yorkshire badly hit by
        colonial boycotts of English goods→ Yorkshire Association call
        for economic and parliamentary reform

        i.  Committee designed to sustain pressure, movement spread to
            other parts of the country

    d.  Had impact on future form of association in English politics

2)  Provisioning food in France

    a.  National states became responsible for guaranteeing food supply
        and were held responsible when it failed (69)

    b.  Biggest issue was to keep Paris fed, because state saw as Paris
        perfectly capable of overthrowing the state (population wise)

    c.  That included the market of grain and caused rifts between the
        local communities and those institutions responsible for
        ensuring Paris gets food

    d.  During grain shortages consumers were blocking the export of
        grain and demanding just prices for bread, local officials were
        barring Parisian suppliers from the local trade (70)

    e.  People protesting, i.e. women of Paris marching on Versailles
        demanding bread

    f.  Food became a pivot for the spread of the eventual French
        Revolution

3)  Levying taxes in America

    a.  Growth of modern state most contested in revolts against the
        burden of taxes

    b.  Late 18th century those revolts became broad based and well
        organized to feed into national movements

    c.  Britain seeing colonies as cash cows to finance wars (Stamp Act)

    d.  New fiscal policy on the colonies was offensive and difficult to
        collect

        i.  Threatened autonomy of the colonial political system that
            was the instrument of indirect rule (71)

    e.  Revolting meant stopping the financial strategy of the most
        powerful empire at the time (71)

    f.  It led to revolution because Britain refused to desist

        i.  Wanted money

        ii. Fear of diffusion (rouge colonies)

The state as target and mediator:

-   As state was expanding and penetrated society

    -   Shift of targets for collective action from private and local
        actors to national centers of decision making

    -   Tilly observes this shift around the late 18th century

-   State building also led to broader framing of citizen action

    -   Created new social identities

        -   I.e change in tax law brought together groups of people from
            all walks of lives → tax revolts looked much different

-   State-building also gave groups new tools to organize and petition
    the government

    -   Not just grievances against the state

    -   But using state as mediator for grievances amongst groups

-   These opportunities created by the state were both short term and
    long term

    -   Short term opportunities (coming of French Revolution)

        -   King in attempt to appease opening up opportunities of
            Estates General (people were forming alliances and organizes
            and collecting grievances to be discussed, voting on who to
            send to the Estates as their delegates)

        -   Once Estates in place, connection kept with their local
            "districts" which were giving instructions on how to vote

    -   Long term opportunities (making of the American working class)

        -   Workers were urban (unlike Europe), given vote earlier

        -   Workers' collective action directed at ballot box, workers
            were territorially oriented → urban political machines
            having to reckon with territory and ethnicity of the working
            class

-   Not all long term changes in state structures created opportunties

    -   Fear of movements led to increase of police force, restriction
        on association and assembly (i.e. British creating professional
        police force in 1829)

    -   Similar tendencies observed in France in mid 19th century

    -   But states had to come to accept some forms of collective action

        -   Some accepted, some rejected

        -   Had to sort of arrange themselves with their society

    -   Some social movements even had transnational effects
        (workers'movement in Europe)
