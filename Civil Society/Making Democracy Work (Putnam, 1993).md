Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy

Robert Putnam

Notetaker: Tim Fraser

1\. Central Question: What are the conditions for creating strong,
responsive, effective representative institutions.

a.  Puzzle: Why do some democratic governments succeed (have better
    institutional performance/governance) while others fail (to do so)?

b.  Variables

    i.  Outcome variable: Institutional Performance, using 12
        indicators. "Institutions are devices for achieving purposes,
        not just for achieving agreement. We want government to do
        things, not just decide things - to educate children, pay
        pensioners, stop crime, create jobs, hold down prices, encourage
        family values, and so on" (9).

    ii. Explanatory variables:

        1.  Key explanatory variable: social capital (sociocultural
            factors)

        2.  Socioeconomic factors

        3.  Institutional change?

c.  Why did some of 15 subnational regional government units newly
    created in the 1970s + 5 special regions in Italy succeed while
    others failed?

d.  The quality of governance institutions is compared here, as are the
    causes of variation in those institutions.

2\. Central Argument. Collaborative institutions seem to work better
than ruling cliques, and it's because they involve social capital,
trust, and rotating credit associations - and it works even though no
central government leviathan stands ready to punish those who shirk the
rules. This is significant because Olsun and Migdal argued that stronger
civil society means weaker government and weaker economies, but Putnam
finds the opposite. *Social context and history profoundly condition the
effectiveness of institutions.* Also, *changing formal institutions can
change political practice*.

3\. Scope conditions

4\. What cases does researcher use? Context of study

-   Case: subnational regional government units in Italy.

-   Context: 15 newly created in 1970s, alongside 5 special regions,
    which wrested away control from historically centralized government.
    Some new regions governed effectively, while others failed to
    respond to citizen needs or represent them well.

5\. Functional Outline:

-   Chapter 2: How has institutional performance changed over time?
    (Descriptive)

    -   Describes development of regional autonomy movement. Argues that
        *institutional change* caused the change in *political practice*
        â†’ the creation of political cliques, local party bosses,
        etc.That political practice changed after institutional change
        was introduced.

-   Chapter 3: Measuring Performance: Which communities have better
    institutional performance? (Descriptive)

    -   Cabinet stability, budget promptness, statistical and
        information services, reform legislation, legislative
        innovation, day care centers, family clinics, industrial policy
        instruments, agricultural spending capacity, local health unit
        expenditures, housing and urban development, bureaucratic
        responsiveness. Equally split index, but those with good
        governmental functioning (the first six) tend to have good
        outputs too (the last six).

    -   Strong correlation between institutional performance index and
        citizen satisfaction rates (r = 0.84)

    -   Strong correlation between performance pre-1976 and post-1978.

-   Chapter 4: Why do some communities have better institutional
    performance than other? (civic engagement) (Causal)

-   Chapter 5: Why are some communities more civic than others? (Causal)

-   Chapter 6: Conclusion: Why does social capital/civic engagement so
    powerfully boost institutional performance?

6\. Research methods:

-   Mixed methods: Italian Regional Experiment: case studies, bivariate
    correlations, scatterplots

    -   Interviews with regional, community leaders

    -   Nationwide surveys

7\. Kind of Analysis: Historical institutionalist: consequences of
institutional change, not institutional design.

8\. Critiques, Questions, Limitations

-   Could have been good for QCA to show how combination of factors
    matter

-   Could have been good for multiple regression to show independent
    effects of variables controlled for others. Putnam seems not to know
    the method, or doesn't use it because of small-n.

-   Could have narrowed the argument using logistic regression on many
    explicit indicators of institutional performance, had he had more
    cases.
