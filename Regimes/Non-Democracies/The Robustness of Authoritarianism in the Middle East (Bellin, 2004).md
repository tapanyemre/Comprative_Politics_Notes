# Long Summary


Bellin, Eva. 2004. "The Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle
East." *Comparative Politics* 36(2): 139-157

*Most of this is directly from the text*

Explanations suggest a litany of regional failures. First, civil society
is weak and thus is an ineffective champion of democracy. Labor unions
are empty shells; businessmen's associations lack credible autonomy;
nongovernmental organizations lack indigenous grounding. The weakness of
associational life undermines the development of countervailing power in
society that can force the state to be accountable to collective
deliberation, stunting the development of a civic culture, that
essential underpinning of vibrant democracy.

**Key Takeaways:**

-   ï»¿The commanding heights of the economy remain largely in state hands

-   People are poor; literacy rates are low; and inequality is
    significant

-   Countries in the region are geographically remote from the epicenter
    of democratization

-   Blames Islam for a lack of democracy

-   Asks why the vast majority of the Middle East and North Africa have
    failed to initiate transition at all

-   Coercive state deeply opposed to democratic reform has quashed
    initiatives favorable to democracy

-   Robustness of coercive apparatus is directly linked to maintenance
    of fiscal health

-   Patrimonialism confers a number of distinct advantages on
    authoritarian regimes that can contribute to their longevity

-   Under patrimonial conditions, political reform represents the
    prospect of ruin for the elite of the elite of the coercive
    apparatus

-   The Islamist threat demobilizes much of the traditional constituency
    for democratic activism

-   Multiple western security concerns in the region guarantee
    continuous international support to authoritarian regimes in the
    MENA region.

-   Where patrimonial institutions are wedded to coercive capacity,
    authoritarianism is likely to endure
