# Long Summary


\*There are 2 pages of pictures, it's not that long of a summary\*

Magaloni, "Credible Power-Sharing and Longevity of Authoritarian Rule"

In this picture, she's saying "I'm from Stanford, you peasant"

**IV**: party infrastructure, elections

**DV**: longevity of authoritarian rule

**Nutshell**: she explores the role of autocratic political
parties/elections in mitigating the commitment problem (where dictators
don't abuse their friends and those friends play ball, not forming
subversive coalitions). This makes power sharing between the dictator
and his ruling coalition possible. Her article develops a theory of
power sharing under autocracy and impact on regime longevity.

Dictator's Dilemma-how to ensure against defection/control challenges

**Existing Lit:** dictators have 2 tools to survive in office-

1.  Repressing their rivals

2.  Co Opting them w/ gifts

-the author uses a game to illustrate why it's more complicated than
that

-   Essentially, the game shows that people who receive gifts/office
    have to continue to pose a threat so the dictator doesn't ignore his
    policy agenda and make him want to rebel anyway

-   So the dictator has to commit not to abuse his friends

    -   This is difficult, but the dictator can delegate control of the
        access-to-power positions and privileges to a party, further
        guaranteeing power/spoils over the long run to those that don't
        rebel.

    -   He's basically making the ruling coalition vest their interests
        in the survival of the dictatorship

    -   this establishes credible limits to abuse of power

**Claim**: dictator will want to uphold a system of credible power
sharing w/ his ruling clique to make himself less vulnerable in power.

-   Also, regular multiparty elections help increase bargaining power of
    the ruling party vis a vis dictator

**Parties and Intemporal Power Sharing**

-   Dictators can solve dilemma by allowing existence of party that
    guarantees to members that investment in the institutions will pay
    off over time

    -   By credibly promising a share of power, which can only come from
        giving up absolute power and cutting in the ruling party

-   Regular elections happen, even though dictator's party is the only
    meaningful one, so the power sharing deal can be effective.

    -   It's a way to promote potential rivals to better positions
        regularly (to stave off rebellion)

-   She doesn't address origin points of parties

My interpretation of this:

Dictator -\> parties/elections that control access to stuff -\> \<-
potential rivals

**Why Multiparty Elections-**

-   Sometimes, for the good stuff you get from the democratic facade
    (intl support, etc)

-   Allowing them gives political rivals a window of challenge, which
    works to constrain the dictator. This is part of the power sharing
    deal the dictator implicates to stay in power and stave off
    subversive challenge

    -   Also, keeping his own party united means he has to offer
        concessions
