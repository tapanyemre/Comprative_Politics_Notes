# Long Summary


**Lust-Okar, *Structuring Conflict in the Arab World: Incumbents,
Opponents, and Institutions***

\*\**FYI - Crazy week cooped up at home, so this actually a summary of a
book review. Sorry, this is all I really had time for.\*\*\**

-   Institutions matter in autocratic regimes as well as democratic ones

<!-- -->

-   Question: Why do some autocratic regimes survive while others
    democratize or collapse?

<!-- -->

-   DV: autocratic longevity

-   IV: institutions (specifically, structures of contestation)

    -   Are opposition groups unified or divided

<!-- -->

-   Unified structure of contestation:

    -   Lends itself more to challenge the government

    -   Lower costs for opposition groups when joining together

    -   As crisis continues and probability of a successful challenge
        increases, all political opponents will be more likely to
        challenge (kind of like the bandwagoning thing we talked about
        toward the beginning of the semester \-- Laitin???)

-   Divided structure of contestation:

    -   Government can influence intergroup relations by favoring one
        group over others by giving them concessions or some other kind
        of reward for loyalty - this creates included and excluded
        groups

    -   The included opposition will be less likely to challenge the
        government even though its demands have not been fully met
        because the costs of toppling the regime will increase as more
        and more radical excluded groups join the conflict
