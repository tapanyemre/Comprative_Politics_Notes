Nodding or Needling: Analyzing Delegate Responsiveness in an
Authoritarian Parliament (2010)

Edmund Malesky (Duke)

Paul Schuler (Arizona)

Q: What ensures longevity and economic growth in an authoritarian
regime?

A: Some have argued for cooptation, when an authoritarian regime offers
the opposition limited policy influence in a national legislature.

Problem: Cooptation theory generates a number of predictions for
delegate behavior within an authoritarian parliament yet this has been
difficult to test due to the opacity of such regimes.

Methods: Analyzing transcripts (content analysis) of query sessions in
the 12th Vietnamese National Assembly (VNA) of 2007-2012, where
delegates question the prime minister and cabinet members on important
issues of the day. Transcripts analyzed are only through 2009/2010???
and data is unavailable for previous VNA sessions.

Main Hypothesis: Sources of institutional variation (nomination
procedures, electoral competitiveness, professionalism of delegates as
**IV**s) in the VNA have the potential to alter delegate behavior in the
Assembly (**DV**).

Findings:

1.  First, nomination procedures greatly affect whether delegates are
    responsive upward toward national leaders or downward to their
    underlying provincial constituency. Delegates who are more dependent
    on the central party and state for nomination and future promotion
    appear less willing to participate, challenge the government, and
    represent the interests of their voters.

2.  Electoral competitiveness also matters. Delegates emerging from
    closely contested elections raise more critical queries of national
    authorities than those with safe seats.

3.  Finally, the professionalism of delegates dictates how well they
    respond to constituency interests. Full-time members who have more
    information and a greater stake in their roles as representatives
    tend to perform their representative functions more seriously.
    Specifically, full-time local delegates are three times more likely
    to ask questions and criticize ministers, and twice as likely to
    reference local issues in their speeches as their peers.

Significance: This is the first empirical test of delegate behavior in
nondemocratic parliaments. These findings not only provide evidence for
cooptation in Vietnam, but also illustrate how Vietnamese leaders manage
the dangers of bringing alternative voices into the policymaking process
through carefully designed electoral and assembly rules.
