# Long Summary

Gandhi, Jennifer. 2008. "Political Institutions Under Dictatorship."
*Cambridge University Press*. Introduction, Chapters 2-4.

*Most of this is directly from the text*

Introduction:

**Key Takeaways:**

-   ï»¿Democratic institutions constitute mere window dressing that
    dictators can point to as evidence of their democratic credentials

-   More heterogeneity exists in the number of political parties
    tolerated by authoritarian regimes, whether they are allowed simply
    to legally exist or also to obtain seats within the legislature.

-   Dictators face two basic problems of governance. First, as rulers
    who hold power without the legitimacy of having been chosen by their
    citizens, they must prevent attempts to undermine their legitimacy
    and usurp power. They must thwart challenges to their rule. Second,
    autocrats also must solicit the cooperation of those they rule. Even
    if their interests lie only in accumulating wealth and power,
    incumbents will have more to amass if their countries are affluent
    and orderly. Internal prosperity can be generated only if citizens
    contribute their capital and their labor to productive activates.
    Autocrats, in other words, need compliance and cooperation

-   The degree to which they face serious threats to their rule depends
    on the strength of the potential opposition within society.

-   If rulers have access to external sources of revenue, for example,
    they may rely less on the cooperation of domestic groups for the
    creation of wealth.

-   To both thwart rebellion and solicit cooperation, dictators must
    make concessions to outside groups.

-   Concessions may come in the form of rents; the dictator may agree to
    distribute some of his spoils to certain segments of society as a
    solution to these two problems of governance.

-   If authoritarian leaders face a weak opposition and need little
    cooperation, they will not need to make concessions and, therefore,
    will not need institutions. But if they must impede opposition
    mobilization and solicit outside cooperation, rulers may need to
    make policy concessions, in which case they need institutions to
    organize these compromises.

-   As a forum through which dictators can make policy concessions,
    nominally democratic institutions are instruments of co-optation.

Chapter 2

**Key Takeaways:**

-   Again, dictators confront two basic problems of governance: they
    must solicit the cooperation of some part of their citizenry even to
    achieve the most modest of aims in addition to counteracting any
    active opposition to their rule.

-   Uses Kuwait, Morocco and Ecuador as case studies

-   In tackling these daunting tasks without the resources available to
    states such as Kuwait (oil), authoritarian incumbents in Morocco and
    Ecuador had to enlist the help of significant segments of their
    populations.

-   In exchange for assistance, dictatorial rulers undoubtedly offered
    material benefits.

-   Along with rents, group within society also demand participation

-   The Kuwaiti case shows that when the emirs no longer needed the
    cooperation of the merchants after the discovery of oil, they
    disbanded the movement for parliamentarism because they no longer
    needed to make concessions to this group.

-   In contrast, in Morocco, after independence, the king and his son
    had to establish their legitimacy and reconstruct their country.
    Facing such Herculean tasks with few resources and an opposition
    that had grown strong in the nationalist struggle, the ruling family
    had to make some concessions. After some turmoil, both sides settled
    on a full panoply of legislative parties that survive to this day
    under monarchical rule.

-   In Ecuador, the challenges of establishing a sound footing for the
    economy were no less pressing. But after misguidedly dismantling the
    legislature and parties, the military junta could not obtain the
    cooperation of even those who were the ostensible beneficiaries of
    its program.

-   The result was the quick demise of the regime at the hands of a
    well-mobilized opposition.

-   These cases provide some intuitions for why dictators govern with
    nominally democratic institutions.

Chapter 3

**Key Takeaways:**

-   To mobilize cooperation and to deter larger segments of society from
    forming active opposition, dictators try to protect themselves with
    institutions.

-   A system of institutions (a legislature and political parties)
    provides a means by which autocrats can encapsulate the potential
    opposition.

-   Democratic institutions serve as the channel through which rents can
    be distributed, and more importantly, as the forum in which policy
    compromises can be organized.

-   By offering to particular groups of potential opposition a place in
    the legislature, dictators induce these groups to vest their
    interests in the status quo.

-   By creating a single party, dictators offer a vehicle for career
    advancement within their institutional creations.

-   For both the dictator and the potential opposition, nominally
    democratic legislatures and parties reduce political transaction
    costs although not without distributive consequences because
    incumbents retain the power to alter or close such insutitons.

-   The degree of cooperation that rulers must solicit is related to the
    structure of the economy and to the type of dictatorship

-   Mineral-rich dictatorships, particularly those headed by monarchs
    but also by professional military, need little cooperation from
    their populations.

-   Those dictators who cannot generate rents without mobilizing
    cooperation and who are forced to co-opt some of the potential
    opposition to survive in power, build, and maintain a full panoply
    of institutions.

-   Policies in authoritarian regimes with legislatures and parties
    should reflect more of a compromise between the autocrat and the
    potential opposition than the policies adopted in
    noninstitutionalized regimes where rulers need not make concessions.

-   If dictators maintain legislatures and parties and make policy
    concessions to broaden their bases of support, intuitions should
    have effects on their political survival.

Chapter 4

**Key Takeaways:**

-   The crucial assumption linking concessions to institutions, however,
    is that policy compromises cannot be made outside the shelter of
    legislatures and parties.

-   Within these institutions, leaders of religious organizations,
    business and labor associations, and various other groups can
    express demands that do not appear as acts of public resistance to
    the regime.

-   The dictator, in turn, uses legislatures and parties as a way to
    control dissent and to make concessions while appearing to be
    magnanimous rather than weak.

-   Because dictators very in their need to make concessions and,
    consequently, to have institutions, there should be differences in
    policies across differently organized authoritarian regimes.

-   Consistent with expectations, more institutionalized dictatorships
    spend less on the armed forces than their noninstitutionalized
    counterparts.

-   Yet they do not compensate with more resources for education,
    health, and welfare.

-   It could be that institutionalized regimes engage in more
    corruption.

-   Alternatively, lower social spending within institutionalized
    regimes may indicate the difficulty of building coalitions for
    programs that are not truly public goods.

-   As a result, members of nominally democratic institutions should be
    more able to coordinate their efforts to demand these rights in the
    face of authoritarian power.

-   Institutionalized dictatorships, then, should have more liberalized
    rights policies.

-   More institutionalized regimes allow for greater freedom of speech
    along with better protection of workers' rights.
