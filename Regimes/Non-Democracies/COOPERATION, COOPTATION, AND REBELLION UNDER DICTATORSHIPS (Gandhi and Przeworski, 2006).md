COOPERATION, COOPTATION, AND REBELLION UNDER DICTATORSHIPS (2006)

JENNIFER GANDHI AND ADAM PRZEWORSKI

This is just the abstract:

Dictatorships are not all the same: some are purely autocratic but many
exhibit a full panoply of seemingly democratic institutions. To explain
these differences, we develop a model in which dictators may need co-
operation to generate rents and may face a threat of rebellion.
Dictators have two instruments: they can make policy concessions or
share rents. We conclude that when they need more cooperation dictators
make more extensive policy concessions and share fewer rents. In turn,
when the threat of rebellion is greater, they make larger concessions
but also distribute more spoils. Assuming that policy concessions
require an in- stitutional setting of legislatures and parties, we test
this prediction statistically for all dictatorships that existed between
1946 and 1996.
