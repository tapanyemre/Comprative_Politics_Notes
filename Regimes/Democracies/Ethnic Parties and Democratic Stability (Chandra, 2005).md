# Long Summary


Kanchan Chandra, "Ethnic Parties and Democratic Stability"

*\*\*I had a lot of trouble following the thought process of this
reading, but I'm not sure if I am simply missing something or if the
logic is actually flawed (most likely it is the former). There is stuff
in here that makes sense and I like, but the overall argument is
confusing to me.\*\**

-   ethnic divisions are traditionally seen as a threat to democratic
    stability

-   "Ethnic outbidding" - a single ethnic party corrupts the democratic
    system â†’ ethnic extremism

<!-- -->

-   Main argument: ethnic parties can actually sustain a democracy,
    depending on the institutional context

    -   Institutions that allow for "politicization of multiple
        dimensions of ethnic identity" can sustain democracy (236)

<!-- -->

-   Constructivist - identities are fluid, multidimensional, endogenous
    to politics

<!-- -->

-   Methods: case study of India, where parties have emerged based on
    language, tribe, caste, region, religion, etc., and have become more
    centrist in the post-colonial period

-   Institutional encouragement for ethnic parties eventually leads
    extremist parties to the center

<!-- -->

-   Past models:

    -   Step 1: 2 ethnic groups have polar opposite preferences on
        ethnic issue.

    -   Step 2: Ethnic party emerges, appeals to majority, and is
        countered by an ethnic party of the opposing side.

    -   Step 3: New parties become more and more extreme while vying for
        the votes of the two ethnic groups

<!-- -->

-   But in India, originally extreme ethnic parties became more centrist
    over time. Why?

-   Explanation 1: There are many small ethnic groups, a coalition must
    be formed with a more moderate platform.

    -   But this view is primordial, as it emphasizes some elements of
        identity over others

-   Explanation 2: Crosscutting cleavages prevent majorities because
    voters can and will be mobilized on different dimensions of cleavage
    (example: if a majority party forms based on a religious cleavage,
    another party may emerge emphasizing a different aspect of ethnic
    identity like language)

    -   The author likes this explanation, but says it is incomplete,
        which leads to.....

-   **Explanation 3**: Institutionalization (or the attachment of
    political payoffs to mobilization) of crosscutting cleavages
    explains variation in democratic outcomes

    -   Basically, Chandra supports the crosscutting thesis, but adds
        the institutionalization component, saying that without this
        element, it is difficult to activate these cleavages for
        political purposes.

    -   Also argues that this framework outlines when political
        entrepreneurs would act on these cleavages (i.e. when they are
        in the minority based on the current cleavage structure)

    -   Third argument, this framework specifies why crosscutting
        cleavages are likely to produce centrism (this is the part I
        don't understand.....Unfortunately it is also the main argument
        of the paper)
