# Long Summary

#### *Note: Found this summary online of pages 48-105, which we are supposed to skim. It seems alright and gets the points across.* 

#### **Chapter 4: The Socioeconomic Order: Concentration or Dispersion?**

-   Main questions:

1)  *Do some socioeconomic orders affect the probability that a hegemony
    will change to a competitive regime more than others?*

2)  *Are the chances that a polyarchy will remain so dependent on the
    socioeconomic order?*

-   The government will tolerate the opposition more as its capacity to
    use violence or socioeconomic sanctions on it diminishes.

-   The most favorable circumstance for competitive regimes is one in
    which access to violence and socioeconomic sanctions is either
    displaced or denied to both the opposition and the government.

-   A competitive regime or polyarchy is unlikely to be maintained
    without a pluralistic social order. A centralized social order is
    conducive to a hegemonic regime.

-   A competitive regime cannot be maintained where the military or the
    police routinely intervene in politics.

#### **Chapter 5: The Socioeconomic Order: Level of Development**

-   This chapter deals with the question of whether higher socioeconomic
    development leads to more competitive regimes.

-   Dahl addresses the possibility of \"thresholds\" and of \"deviant
    cases.\"

-   Dahl puts forth the hypothesis that a competitive regime is more
    likely in countries which

    -   Provide literacy, education, and communication,

    -   Create a pluralistic, rather than centrally dominated social
        order, and

    -   Prevent extreme inequalities among the politically relevant
        elements of society.

**Chapter 6: Equalities and Inequalities**

-   resources equal political power in the long run.

-   Dahl allows for the possibility that it is possible that even if
    government policies that try to reduce inequality fail, the effort
    may be enough to mitigate the complaints of the deprived group.

-   Dahl demonstrates through the examples of Athens and the United
    States, that it is possible to develop and sustain a system that is
    both competitive with respect to the dominant group and hegemonic
    with respect to a minority population.

-   Dahl presents a study that came to the conclusion that people often
    judge their situation on the perceived direction of change of the
    larger collective with which they identify themselves with.

#### **Chapter 7: Subcultures, Cleavage Patterns, and Governmental Effectiveness**

-   There are many subcultures that individuals are socialized into

    -   Race

    -   Religion

    -   Language

    -   Sex

    -   Class

    -   Region

-   Ethnic and religious conflicts are oftentimes the most contentious
    conflicts because assaults on ethnicity and religion are assaults on
    a fundamental characteristic of person.

-   Dahl lays out three conditions for countries that have many
    subcultures in order to maintain low conflicts and thus polyarchy.

    -   Conflict is likely to be low if no minority or ethnic or
        religious subculture is denied the opportunity to participate in
        the government.

    -   There are direct or indirect guarantees that provide a high
        degree of security for the various subcultures.

    -   The chances for a polyarchy are more likely if the people think
        that the government is addressing the important problems that
        the country faces.

-   Two significant political institutions are the relationship between
    the executive and the legislative, and political parties
