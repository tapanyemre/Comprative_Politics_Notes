# Long Summary


"The Civic Culture"

*\*\*\*Another dense one. Why did everyone write like this in the
60s????*

[Chapter 1]{.underline}

-   This book will examine the features of a "civic culture" and the
    role it plays in the maintenance of democracy

-   **Question**: Under what conditions will democracies emerge in a
    modernizing state?

-   **DV**: regime type (maintenance of democracy)

-   **IV**: cultural features (civic culture)

<!-- -->

-   Civic culture = High degrees of political participation and concern
    for political affairs + individuals oriented to input structures and
    processes + individuals are both participants and
    subjects/parochials (see below)

<!-- -->

-   Past theorists who argue that there is a correlation between indices
    of modernization and stable democratization omit "cultural and
    psychological consequences of 'modern' technologies and processes"
    (11)

<!-- -->

-   Methodology: surveys given to about 1,000 people each in five
    different countries (US, Britain, Germany, Italy, Mexico)
    \*\*\*Remember this is 1963 - they wanted to get a range of
    "democracy" types in order to see if there was a difference in civic
    cultures that explained strength of democracy\*\*\*

<!-- -->

-   Theory: There are three types of political culture

    -   Parochial - no defined/specialized political roles

    -   Subject - orientation to/knowledge of general system and output
        products

    -   Participant - Orientation to/knowledge of all aspects of
        democracy tested in survey

-   Systems are not heterogeneous in terms of civic culture (can have
    parochial individuals in participant system)

[Chapter 12]{.underline}

-   **Question**: What sources of political attitudes are most
    significant (in this chapter, focusing specifically on nonpolitical
    experiences)?

-   **Answer**: \*shrug emoji\* \-- Inconclusive. They don't know.
    Minimal effect. (The 53-page chapter was pointless).

<!-- -->

-   Survey questions on sources of political attitudes:

    -   Extent of influence in family decisions growing up

        -   Greater frequency in US and Britain, intermediate in
            Germany, somewhat lower in Italy and Mexico

    -   Formal opportunities to participate in school

        -   Same general pattern, but this time much higher in US

    -   Job participation (involvement in decisions at work)

        -   Same general pattern

-   But each of the above have intervening variables

    -   Family and school participation vary across class (education
        levels used as a proxy) and based on age of respondents
        (increasing participation over time in all five countries)

    -   Job participation varies by occupation

<!-- -->

-   Since political participation is higher in the US and Britain and
    lowest in Italy and Mexico, the above data appears to show some link
    between nonpolitical experiences and democratic participation

-   But there are some problems (alluded to above)

<!-- -->

-   In all 5 countries, respondents who participated in family decisions
    are more likely to participate in democracy

    -   Connection disappears for those with higher education levels and
        for younger respondents

-   Those who were able to participate in school appear somewhat more
    likely to participate in democracy, but the relationship is not
    strong and varies across demographics

-   Job participation seems to be a bit more salient (though it is less
    clear in Mexico)

    -   Relationship with political participation remains strong even
        across education groups

    -   They note, however, that there is likely a reciprocal effect

-   There is a **cumulative effect** when each of the above conditions
    are met

-   Rank order of importance: job, school, family

<!-- -->

-   Basically, the extent to which the IV influences the DV is
    inconclusive

[Chapter 13]{.underline}

-   **Question**: How are different characteristics correlated with
    differences in political orientation, in general and by country
    (focus on education and gender)? Is this generalizable across
    countries?

-   Education level seems to have the greatest effect (even after
    controlling for other characteristics associated with education like
    income, occupation, gender, etc.)

<!-- -->

-   In each country, educated classes have greater capacity for
    political participation, awareness of politics, cogent political
    opinions

<!-- -->

-   Difference across countries within same education level, but general
    trend is the same

    -   Less educated tends to be more parochial and subject subcultures

<!-- -->

-   Men show higher frequency and intensity in almost all indices of
    political orientation and activity, but patterns differ from country
    to country (smaller difference between genders in the US and UK)

    -   Why?

        -   Open vs closed families (open to community in US and UK)

-   Role of women is essential to civic culture (this understanding is
    becoming the norm

<!-- -->

-   Other demographics can't be tested well in this study given the
    sample size
