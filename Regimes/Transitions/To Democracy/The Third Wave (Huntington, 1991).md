# Long Summary





*Disclaimer: first two chapters are roughly 100 pages, this is an
overview, not an in-depth summary*

**Huntington**

**"The Third Wave - Democratization in the late 20th Century"**

### **Chapter 1: The basics**

-   Subject of book: transitions to democracy between 1974 and 1990

-   This book defines democracy through a procedural definition

    -   Central procedure is the selection of leaders through
        competitive elections by the people they govern (ala Schumpter)

    -   "This study defines a 20th century political system as
        democratic to the exten that its most powerful collective
        decision makers are selected through fair, honest, and periodic
        elections in which candidates freely compete for votes and in
        which virtually all the adult population is eligible to vote"
        (7)

    -   Democracy involves two dimensions

        -   Contestation and participation (think Dahl)

-   Additional aspects when defining democracy:

    -   Defining by election is minimal

        -   Democracies need to actually distinguish themselves from
            other characteristics of political systems

    -   Election of leaders useless if they are not capable to exercise
        power

    -   Stability of the system should be incorporated into the system

    -   Should democracies and non-democracies be treated dichotomous or
        on a continuous scale (for his study dichotomy b/c looking at
        transition)

    -   Non-democratic regimes do not have electoral competition and
        widespread voting participation

-   **Modern democracy** is democracy of the nation-state (past could
    have been a village or a tribe)

-   Wave of democratization is a group of transitions from nondemocratic
    to democratic regimes occurring within a specific period of time and
    outnumber the transition in the opposite direction

    -   Three waves of democratization occurred in modern world

        -   Small number of countries affected

        -   Some transitions in the nondemocratic direction

    -   History is not unidirectional, first two waves accompanied by
        reverse waves (see page 14)

    -   First wave:

        -   Jonathan Sunshine set forth basic criteria (50% adult males
            eligible to vote, responsible executive who either must
            maintain majority support in elected parliament or is chosen
            in periodic popular elections)

        -   Therefore, US began first wave in 1828, Switzerland, France,
            GB, Italy and Argentina (right before WW1)

        -   Early 1930s first wave ends

    -   First reverse:

        -   1922 March on Rome begins the reverse, reverse reflects rise
            of communist, fascist and militaristic ideology

        -   Most democratic countries that had established democracy
            shortly before WW1, where the concept was new and unstable

        -   Only 4 of 17 countries that adopted democracy btw 1910 and
            1931 maintained them throughout the 1920s and 1930s

    -   Second Wave:

        -   WW2 begins next short wave till early 1960s

        -   Inauguration of democratic institutions in West Germany,
            Italy, Austria, Japan and Korea

        -   Greece Turkey late 1940s, early 1950s; Latin America only
            briefly

        -   Fall of colonial power brings about new countries, no real
            effort made to introduce democratic institutions

    -   Second reverse:

        -   Latin America most dramatic shift to authoritarianism

        -   Asian countries affected as well

        -   End of colonization in Africa led "to the largest
            multiplication of independent authoritarian governments in
            history" (21)

        -   Created "bureaucratic authoritarianism" theory

        -   Created pessimism about applicability of democracy to
            developing countries and about its stability in developed
            countries

    -   Third wave:

        -   End of portuguese dictatorship in 1974 begins third wave

        -   Since then democratic regimes introduced in roughly 30
            countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America → generally global
            movement

        -   I.e. Think collapse of communist rule in DDR, CZ, RO

-   Two take-aways:

    -   It seems that the wave/reverse system is two steps forward, 1
        step back → not the case

    -   Rather: "states come in many shapes and sizes, and in the
        post-WW2 decades the number of independent states doubled. Yet
        the proportions of democratic states in the world show a
        considerable regularity."

-   The big issues concerning democracy (and its scholarship): extent
    and permanence

    -   Is it a long-term global trend?

    -   Or is it a limited form of political regime solely for
        wealthy/western world?

-   Huntington suggests that what is more important in studying
    countries is the distinction between order and anarchy, rather than
    democratic and nondemocratic

    -   Provides reasons for why, related to things we attribute with
        democracies and how they affect certain values in society

    -   1\) political democracy closely associated with freedom of
        individual

    -   2\) political stability and form of government are two different
        variables (but relation between democracy and stability)

    -   3\) spread of democracy has implications for international
        relations

        -   Expansion of democracy means expansion of zone of peace

**Chapter 2: Causes of series of transitions**

-   Four possible reasons for democracy to occur simultaneously in
    various countries

    -   Single cause

    -   Parallel development

    -   Snowballing

    -   Prevailing nostrum

        -   Not exhaustive, not mutually exclusive, not necessarily
            contradictory

-   **Dependent variable is democratization in this study (not
    democracy)**

-   **Independent: possible causes of democratization**

-   Purpose: explain why some countries became democratic in a
    particular period of time (34)

-   In its simplest form democratization involves

    -   End of an authoritarian regime

    -   The installation of a democratic regime

    -   The consolidation of the democratic regime

        -   Different and contradictory causes may be responsible for
            each of these three developments (35)

-   In order to explain an event happening, it has to be theoretically
    overdetermined b/c usually there are more causes then one

    -   Think all the possible reasons we have discussed in class for
        democracy to occur (37/38)

    -   No single factor sufficient enough to explain

    -   No single factor necessary for development towards democracy

    -   Democratization caused due to mix

    -   Mix varies from country to country

    -   Mix responsible for one wave is different than mix for next wave

    -   Causes for initial regime change differ from later responsible

-   First wave key features

    -   Industrialization, urbanization

    -   Gradual decrease economic inequality

    -   Intellectual ethos shaped

    -   Protestantism

-   Second wave key features

    -   Political and military factors

<!-- -->

-   In order to explain third wave, 2 questions need to be answered

    -   1\) why did some 30 countries with authoritarian systems but not
        about 100 other authoritarian countries shift to democratic
        political systems?

    -   2\) why did regime changes in these countries occur in the 1970s
        and 1980s and not at some other time? (40/41)

-   Nature of the authoritarian regime cannot explain, as they were all
    diverse

-   Other explanation could be looking at histories of regime change

    -   Cyclical patterns

    -   Second try pattern

    -   Interrupted democracy

    -   Direct transition

    -   Decolonization pattern

-   All countries of third wave encompass these five patterns

-   Huntington argues that **five changes seem to have taken place in
    1960s and 1970s that affected the possibility of bringing about the
    third wave:**

-   *Jenny: pages 46 - 106 discuss in detail each of the following five
    major causes identified by Huntington*

    -   **Deepening legitimacy problems of the authoritarian regimes**

        -   Legitimacy varies by nature of regime

        -   Legitimacy of most regimes generally declines over time

        -   Authoritarian regimes in 1960s/1970s first benefitted from
            negative legitimacy when implemented, then loss of
            performance legitimacy (usually derived from economic
            growth, now failing due to i.e. oil shocks)

        -   Further, military failure contributed to decline

        -   Also lost legitimacy by actually doing what they said they
            would do (i.e. Argentina restoring order in 1980s, then
            what?)

        -   Huntington illustrates how authoritarian leaders could and
            did respond in five ways

            -   1\) refuse to acknowledge increasing weakness

            -   2\) attempt to survive by becoming increasingly
                repressive

            -   3\) provoke foreign conflict, restore legitimacy through
                appeal to nationalism

            -   4\) attempt to create some sort of democratic
                resemblance

            -   5\) take "bull by horn", end authoritarian regime,
                introduce democracy

    -   **Economic factors**, Unprecedented economic growth in the
        1960s, increased living standards, education, expansion of urban
        middle class

        -   1\) oil price hikes in some countries, Marxist-leninst
            constraints → economic downturn that weakened authoritarian
            regime

        -   2\) early 1970s, many countries achieve overall levels of
            economic development that provided economic basis for
            democracy and facilitated transition to democracy

        -   3\) in some countries, extremely rapid growth destabilized
            authoritarian regimes → either liberalize or repression

        -   Cannot ignore correlation between wealth and democracy

        -   Broad-based economic development key (appears to make
            changes in social structure, education), not just selling
            tons of oil (oil goes to the state, state no need to be
            responsive to citizens)

        -   Most third waves supported by urban middle class (Argentina,
            Philippines, Spain, Taiwan, etc.)

        -   Rapid growth/crises undermine authoritarian regimes

    -   **Striking change in the doctrine and activities of the catholic
        church (becoming opponents of the authoritarian regimes)**

        -   Correlation between Western Christianity and democracy

        -   Democracy scarce in countries that were predominantly
            Muslim, Buddhist or Confucian

        -   Christianity spread to South Korea in the 1960s, 1970s - not
            anywhere else really; Christian converts young, urban,
            middle class (due to social and economic changes in country)

        -   Christianity offered base to oppose political repression

        -   A bigger and more important aspect (for Huntington):
            far-reaching changes "that occured in the doctrine,
            leadership, popular involvement, and political alignment of
            the Roman Catholic Church globally and in many countries"
            (75)

        -   Third wave was a catholic wave: Portugal and Spain one of
            the firsts to transition, then six south american and 3
            central american countries, phillippines, mexico, poland,
            then hungary

        -   Partially attributed to the change of catholic countries
            actually performing well economically (prior to 1950s,
            catholic poor, protestant countries rich)

        -   In 1960s church repositioned itself in opposition to
            authoritarian regimes

            -   At global level: john paul 23 as a person in general and
                from second vatican council (stressing legitimacy and
                need for social change)

            -   At base level of church: new generation of priests,
                popular involvement and activity, grassroots activities

            -   Opposition usually lead to suppression and repression by
                government, which in turn created martyrs of the cause

            -   Transnational organization with mobilization power

    -   **Changes in policies of external actors, new attitude of EC
        towards membership expansion, shift in U.S. policy in 1974
        toward promotion of human rights and democracy in other
        countries, Gorbachev's attitude change of perestroika/glasnost**

        -   "Foreign actors can perhaps be best thought of as hastening
            or retarding the effects of economic and social development
            on democratization" (86)

        -   When countries reach certain economic and social level they
            come into **transition zone**, which increases likelihood of
            democratization

            -   Foreign intervention can create democratization (or
                retard it) before reaching that transition zone

        -   In 1970s and 1980s third wave was massively boosted by
            external actors

            -   Vatican, EC, US, USSR actively promoting liberalization
                and democratization

            -   EC: membership desirable and necessary for economic
                grounds, democracy necessary to become member,
                membership also anchor to slow down/prevent backsliding

            -   Helsinki Process (started through Conference on Security
                and Cooperation in Europe) shuffled in and supported
                limitedly the transition process for Eastern European
                countries (endorsement of large amounts of human rights)

            -   US: promotion of human rights and democracy in other
                countries in four phases

                -   1974 congress stresses promotion of human rights in
                    foreign policy

                -   Carter administration (theme of campaign) placing
                    human rights on "the world agenda" (92)

                -   Reagan administration mostly anti-communist,
                    ignoring Latin American authoritarian regimes

                -   1983/1984 administration shifts to democratic
                    changes in both communist and authoritarian

                -   Tools: statements, economic pressure and sanctions,
                    diplomatic actions, material support for democratic
                    forces, military action, multilateral diplomacy

            -   USSR: changes in Soviet policies shuffled in era of
                democratization in Eastern EUropean countries

                -   Gorbachev revoked Brezhnev doctrine (signaling
                    liberalization and political reform)

                -   Removal of old-guard leaders

                -   Not clear if complete destruction of USSR his
                    intention, but his policies did the trick

    -   **Snowballing or demonstration effects**

        -   Successful democratization happens in one country and this
            encourages other countries

        -   Illustrates that it is in general possible for leaders and
            groups to bring in a new regime

        -   Illustrates how it's done

        -   Educates on dangers/difficulties and what to avoid

        -   Demonstration effect more important in third wave than in
            the previous two (governments had a much harder time
            suppressing media in 1970s than before, "underground media
            networks")

        -   Still, demonstration effect strongest with countries
            geographically proximate and culturally similar (Eastern
            Europe prime example)

        -   Demonstration effect obviously doesn't affect the first
            democratizing countries (those in third wave more due to
            triggers rather than snowball)

            -   Changes in lead countries, though, helped stimulate
                demand in other countries

            -   "In Poland, as the phrase went, democratization took ten
                years, in Hungary ten months, in East Germany ten weeks,
                in Czechoslovakia ten days, and in Romania ten hours."
                (105)

        -   Snowballs melt, however, in unsympathetic environments; if
            environment not conducive movement will fall flat (i.e.
            China, Romania)

<!-- -->

-   These five overarching causes differ significantly from the causes
    of the second wave, less significantly from the first wave

-   Significance of causes varies by region and nature of the regime

-   Also varies by time (factors play larger role depending on when
    process began)

-   Do not make democratization necessary but make it a bigger
    likelihood

-   **"A democratic regime is installed not by trends but by people.
    Democracies are created not by causes but by causers. Political
    leaders and publics have to act." (107)**

-   Leaders cannot will a democracy where environment is not conducive
