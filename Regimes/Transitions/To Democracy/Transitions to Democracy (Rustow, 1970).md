Transitions to Democracy: Toward a Dynamic Model

Dankwart A. Rustow, 1970

Notes: Tim

Question: What conditions make democracy possible and make it thrive?

Answer:

**Competing Explanations (p. 337-339)**

-   Lipset, Cutright, etc: economic and social conditions, eg. high
    income per capita, literacy, urban residence

-   Bagehot, Barker: Common Beliefs and Attitudes on the rules of the
    game, eg. "the agreement to differ" (Barker); Almond and Verba:
    participant civic culture vs. traditional or parochial culture

-   Friedrich, Schattschneider, Crick, Dahrendorf, Lijphart: conflict
    and reconciliation, facilitated by citizens' and politicians'
    membership in multiple, politically relevant groups, foster values
    of reciprocity and democratic rules; Eckstein calls this
    congruence - structures of authority outside government must be more
    democratic if they affect government.

**Three major points of agreement (339-340)**

-   Scholars all study *how democracy stays stable* **("functional
    inquiry"**)*, not how it comes into existence* (**"genetic
    inquiry"**)

-   Focus on contemporary data

-   Major puzzle is why English & Scandinavian Countries have
    functioning democracy while French Third & Fourth Republics and
    Weimar Republic of Germany collapsed.

    -   But what about in the Global South, where scholars wonder why
        some countries become Democracies while others do not?

    -   We call this the ***genetic question*** of democracy***.***

    -   (This reminds me a lot of zero-inflated models, which say that
        the causal effects involved in going from 0 to 1 (eg. getting
        democracy) are different than those going from 1 - infinity (eg.
        keeping democracy))

**What problems occur in transition from Functional to Genetic study of
Democracy?**

-   Apples and oranges problem: Military dictatorships, charismatic
    leaders, and hereditary monarchies appear and sustain themselves
    through different causal mechanisms.

    -   Military dictatorships - secret plotting → armed revolt →
        massive publicity and civilian supporters

    -   Charismatic leaders - perform miracles → establish legitimacy →
        wash and repeat routinely

    -   Lipset and Cutright tried to reconcile these using
        correlations - which are poor at distinguishing causation from
        correlation. Likewise, Almond and Verba's civic culture
        (precursor to social capital research) seems both to cause and
        result from democracy. In short, problems.

    -   Genetic theory does not commit us to determinism, probabilistic
        views, nonlinear correlations, etc.

    -   "Any genetic theory of democracy would do well to assume a
        two-way flow of causality... between politics... and economic
        and social conditions..." (344).

    -   Any theory also must accept conflict and changing alignment
        (Truman, Dahl etc.), choice in the political process (Apter),
        and that circumstances may force or trick non-democrats into
        democratic behavior, changing their beliefs in the process.

    -   Many roads to democracy

    -   Democratic evolution may not be steady process homogenous over
        time. It may vary in shape depending on generation, and
        attitudes may vary across geography in a country.

**Rustow's Explanation/Critique of Democratization:**

-   **History matters.**


**Several Important Points:**

-   **We did not suddenly become political animals in the 1960s.
    Politics has been around for a long time.**

-   **Be careful about comparing countries where democratization came
    from outside (Japan, Iraq) vs. countries where democratization came
    from inside (Mexico, etc.)**

-   **Be careful about comparing countries where military occupation
    (Germany/Japan) or immigrants (Australia, NZ, Israel, US) played a
    role in democracy.**

-   **Completeness/Coverage of all cases by explanation is ideal**

-   **To test at medium or large N level, first identify an ideal type
    of transition from oligarchy to democracy with a number of
    significant factors, tested by a few cases. Then apply that to a
    larger sample. It will be easier and more meaningful than if you try
    to attack all your cases in a medium n sample from the get-go.**

Rustow's comparison of Sweden (1890-1920) and Turkey (1945-1970s)

-   **Background condition: national unity (no reservations about which
    political community they belong to.)** (Did he just forget about the
    Kurds, or were they not active politically at that time?)

    -   Consensus around political norms not really necessary

-   **Preparatory Phase: Prolonged and inconclusive political
    struggle.**

    -   Protagonists = well-entrenched forces (social classes)

    -   Sweden: farmers/working class vs. bureaucrats, landowners,
        industrialists

    -   Turkey: countryside vs. urban Kemalist bureaucratic/military
        establishment

    -   Democracy is often not the original goal, but people turn to it
        in order to achieve an aim, like redistributive policies, rural
        development, etc.

    -   Polarization, not pluralism, defines this era

-   **Decision Phase: Deliberate decision by political leaders to accept
    diversity in unity and institutionalize some aspect of democratic
    procedure**

    -   1907 Great Compromise of Sweden to adopt universal suffrage and
        proportional representation

    -   Decision mens choice; Lebanon frequently chose benevolent
        autocracy or foreign rule as alternative solutions to entrenched
        struggles in preparatory phase

    -   1945 Turkish transition to multiparty system. Radicals accept
        compromise as first installment, confident that future
        installments are on their way; but both conservatives and
        radicals may feel exhausted, leading to equilibrium

        -   Four characteristics of Decision Phase:

            -   How democratic the compromise is may matter less to
                decision makers than other substantive issues

            -   Compromise may feel second-best to major actors; not a
                fundamental commitment to democracy

            -   Continuing different preferences on procedure

            -   Agreement is far from universal and must be transmitted
                to professional politicians and citizens.

-   **Habituation Phase: "A distasteful decision, one made, is likely to
    seem more palatable as one is forced to live with it" (358).**

    -   Swedish Conservative Party transformation 1918-1936

        -   Leaders who grudgingly accepted democracy retired, died, or
            were replaced by those who sincerely believed in it

    -   Turkey post 1945: Ismet Inonu promoted democracy out of duty,
        successor Adnan Menderes saw it as vehicle for his ambition, but
        next, younger leaders grew up in and embraced democracy.

-   Positive Feedback Cycle/Democracy as Policy Learning: "The first
    success, therefore, may encourage contending political forces and
    their leaders to submit other major questions to resolution by
    democratic procedures" (358).

-   Democracy has proved effective in resolving political questions
    where major divisions have been social and economic. It has been the
    fight among religious, national, and racial groups that has proved
    tenacious. (Rebuttal to Marx, who thought that social and economic
    divisions would be most tenacious.)

***Summary: Transition to democracy requires three things;***

1.  *Sense of national unity*

2.  *Entrenched and serious conflict*

3.  *Conscious adoption of democratic rules*

4.  *Habituation of politicians and electorate to these rules*

-   These components must be assembled one at a time, because each has
    its own natural protagonists.

-   Democratizations is a process, a causal mechanism, with multiple
    points where it can go off the rails. Sometimes hiccups occur, eg.
    Turkish crisis of 1960-1961, but even after that, Turkey continued
    its commitment to democracy.

-   Model rejects functional requisites of democracy, like
    economic/social development, or consensus on rules; social welfare
    and education are usually results, not causes, of democratization.
