### First Summary

**Lipset -- Political Man. Chapter 2 - Economic Development and
Democracy [1960]{.underline}**

Democracy is a political system which supplies regular constitutional
opportunities for changing the governing officials, and a social
mechanism which permits the largest possible part of the population to
influence major decisions by choosing among contenders for political
office.

This implies 3 conditions

1.  Political formula which specify which institutions are legitimate.
    -\> peaceful transition of power

2.  Political leaders in office -\> Awarding effective government

3.  Leaders that want to get to the office -\> effective opposition

Author agree with Weber that modern democracy is connected with
capitalism and industrialization. But he thinks that political form may
be developed sometimes due to unique historical factors.

Key historical events may account for either the persistence or the
failure of democracy.

Once established, a democratic political system \"gathers momentum\" and
creates social supports (institutions) to ensure its continued
existence.

Author suggest that countries should be studied by groups (Latin
America, Europe, English-speaking countries and to the lesser extent
Arab countries and Asian states.). In Europe, we see stable or unstable
democracies while in Latin America we see stable or unstable
Dictatorships


**Economic Development in Europe and the Americas**

Here he wants to test the famous hypothesis that *the more well-to-do a
nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy*.

+==================================+===================================+
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Democratic values are correlated with higher education (not only based
on those table). But Germany and France were the most educated countries
in Europe and still had some problems with democracy. so possibly
Education is not sufficient but necessary condition.

Although here various aspects of economic development (Wealth,
urbanization, education and industrialization) were presented separately
they are inter-correlated with each other and form political correlate
of democracy. Then he give an example from old survey (By Lerner) of
middle eastern countries (p.43). Lerner suggested that sort of
modernization theory: first phase is urbanization, then literacy and
media, then industrialization, then newspapers+radio, which increase
literacy even more, and then participation institution (voting).

**Economic Development and the Class Struggle**

-   Here he suggested that there is a correlation between wealth of the
    country and level of support for communist and other extremist
    groups (*this is his wording not*). For instance, in US, UK, New
    Zealand, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, Norway, Belgium,
    Luxembourg and Netherlands are all wealthy countries with low
    support to communists (*in his view socialist are just left so they
    do not count*) while Finland, Austria, Spain (*before Franco*) and
    Greece are lower income countries and they have/had strong communist
    parties.

-   Per capita income has 0.74 correlation with satisfaction with one's
    country. It does not mean that poverty leads to radicalism because
    there is evidence that stable poverty leads to conservatism (47-48).
    Inequality plays important role in level of satisfaction. If we are
    all poor it is fine, but if only me ....

-   So regarding previous statement about wealth and support to
    communist countries should be amended. In poorest countries, usually
    we have higher level of inequality and higher difference in
    standards of life.

<!-- -->

-   Education also reduce receptiveness to extremist ideologies.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In general pyramid stratification  
  encourage more radical ideologies while   
  diamond like shape with growing            
  middle-class rewards moderate parties and  
  penalize extremist groups                  
  ------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The sharp differences in the style of living between those at the
    top and those at the bottom makes the need to treat the lower as
    vulgar and innately inferior psychologically necessary. So the upper
    class does not see any logic in sharing political rights with lower
    class.

-   In addition, if there is not enough wealth in the country holding
    office mean that you have access to resources and you don't want to
    lose this (which lead to corruption and inefficient bureaucracy),
    while if there is enough wealth it is not really important who is in
    power.

-   He also mentions importance of civil society (but he calls it "mass
    society". It is important for creating opposition and new ideas and
    it is also important for tolerance in the society (p.52)

**The Politics of Rapid Economic Development**

-   Classic modernization theory lead to conclusion that west needs to
    industrialize countries in order to prevent them from going to
    communism. But there is high support to communism specifically
    during rapid industrialization. Slower industrialization allow
    society to adapt to changes (for instance develop better housing
    conditions). He provides example of Denmark (slow industrialization)
    and Sweden, and Norway, Germany and Russia (rapid industrialization)
    (p.55-56).

-   As Engels noted revolutionary movements decline when the proletariat
    became stable.

-   He mentioned briefly that fascism develops when there is ever
    present economic vulnerability of middle class.

-   In the end, he reminds Weber's argument about historically unique
    concatenation of factors that engendered Democracy (Protestant
    society-\>burgher class-\>protestant notion of individual
    responsibility-\>democratic values).

**Methodological appendix**

-   In this section, usually complex characteristics of social systems
    were studied within two approaches:

<!-- -->

-   reductionist approach -- maintains that the qualities of individual
    actions are the sum and substance of sociological categories. The
    extent of democratic attitudes, or of bureaucratic behavior, or the
    numbers and types of prestige or power rankings, constitute the
    essence of the meaning of the attributes of democracy, bureaucracy,
    or class. he argued that complex characteristics of social systems
    can be studied by this new method of multivariate analysis (p.59).

-   Ideal type -- (*even longer explanation but he give an example of
    Weber's bureaucracy as detached from everything that beyond the
    features that Weber attribute to it. It is sort of idealistic view
    of how things supposed to be in theory only).*

<!-- -->

-   And then he suggests to use this new ☺ approach of multivariate
    analysis where you can compare different systems in general on
    systemic level (we generalize country's level of democracy even
    though different level of the country has different level of
    democracy)

-   Another revolutionary idea is multivariate causation ☺

-   The appearance of a factors on both sides of \"democracy\" implies
    that once it is established, it sustains various characteristic of
    the society. On the other hand, some of the initial consequences of
    democracy, such as bureaucracy, may have the effect of undermining
    democracy, as the reversing arrows indicate.

-   Democracy not necessary \"causes\" appearance (everything to the
    right), but merely that democracy favors its development.


### Second Summary


One of these is Seymour Lipset, the other is....Newman!

These 2 chps consider 2 characteristics of society that bear on stable
democracies-economic development and legitimacy

**Ch 2: Economic Development and Democracy**

IV: economic development (measured all kinds of ways)

DV: democracy

Nutshell: economic development is much higher in more democratic
countries. Other stuff follows this, like less class struggle. He's (I
think) arguing for multivariate causation of the good stuff that follows
democracy (and democracy itself).

-   Democracy defined as a political system which supplies regular
    constitutional opportunities for changing governing officials and a
    social mechanism allowing the largest possible part of the
    population to influence major decisions by voting

-   Once a democratic system is established, it creates social supports
    to ensure its continued existence

-   He looks at the social conditions that support democratic systems

-   To do this, he looks at differences among countries within the same
    political culture areas

    -   European democracies (uninterrupted continuation of democracy
        without meaningful challenge since WW1)

    -   Latin America (defined by mostly free elections post WW1)

**Economic Development in Europe and the Americas**

-   There\'s a common link assumed between democracy and economic
    development

    -   He tests the hypothesis that the more wealthy a nation, the
        greater the chances it will sustain democracy

    -   Measures of economic development: (I'm including all this cause
        I have a feeling the measures discussion will come up again in
        class, but the takeaway here is: **each of these metrics are
        higher/much higher for more democratic countries**)

        -   **Wealth** (measured by per capita income, persons per motor
            vehicle, thousands of persons per physician, number of
            radios/phones/newspapers per thousand persons)

        -   **Industrialization** (measured by percentage of employed
            males in agriculture and the per capita commercially
            produced energy being used in the country)

        -   **Urbanization** (measured by % of population in communities
            of 20,000 and greater, % in communities of 100,000 and
            greater, % residing in standard metropolitan areas)

        -   **Education** (literacy)

            -   The higher the education level of a population, the
                better the chances for democracy-higher education means
                you're more likely to believe in democratic
                values-education is more significant on its own than
                either income or occupation. Close to a necessary
                condition, but not a sufficient condition for democracy

            -   How do we get from here to democracy?

                -   More educated you are, the less susceptible you
                    become to extremism

    -   These 4 metrics are closely interrelated and form one
        major-factor which has the political correlate of democracy.
        They're causal mechanisms. Taken together, these things impact
        modernization. Output is democracy.

**Economic Development and the Class Struggle**

-   Econ development determines the form of the class struggle

-   Wealthy countries don't have seriously competitive
    communist/socialist parties

    -   These parties become competitive in poorer countries with
        well-to-do lower classes

-   Distribution of consumption goods tends to become more equitable as
    the size of national income increases (pretty sure this is relative
    not absolute gains)

-   Increased wealth and education serve democracy by increasing lower
    class exposure to stuff and reducing their ideological
    commitment/making them less receptive to extremism

**Politics of Rapid Economic Development**

-   Rapid industrialization that's introduced sharp discontinuities
    between pre-industrial and industrial situations **-\>** extremist
    working class movements

-   The revolutionary socialist movements that follow strains of rapid
    industrialization decline when transition to large scale industry is
    complete and proletarian conditions restabilize

    -   Such countries are now the industrialized nations where Marxism
        and friends aren't currently successful

**Ch 3 Social Conflict, Legitimacy, and Democracy**

-   Effectiveness (actual performance) and legitimacy matter to a
    democracy

-   A crisis of legitimacy is a crisis of change.

    -   They occur during transition to a new social structure if:

        -   Status of major institutions threatened (these are
            considered legit in part bc of their continuity)

        -   All major groups don't have access to political systems
            during transition (the entry into politics crisis)

-   A breakdown of effectiveness will endanger even a legit system's
    stability

    -   He has a punnet square for this on the bottom of p 22 of the
        document. I can't get the damn thing to screenshot properly to
        put it here

    -   High legitimacy and effectiveness **-\>** stable politics

    -   Low legitimacy can be damaging even with high effectiveness
        (colonialism)

**Legitimacy and Conflict**

-   Group conflict is important to democracy, but it needs to be
    moderated before it threatens the society

-   Major cleavages that had affected society in modern western nations
    are:

    -   The place of the church, admission of the lower strata to full
        political/economic citizenship, continuing struggle over
        national income distribution

    -   Resolving such tensions one at a time (instead of letting them
        carry over) **-\>** stable pols

    -   Countries vary in how they deal with these issues

-   Evidence suggests that stable democracy more likely when
    groups/individuals have cross cutting politically relevant
    affiliations.

    -   Makes them want less intense political conflict

    -   I'm pretty sure this was basically Chandra's argument

-   Urbanization **-\>** cosmopolitanism and heterogeneity and tolerance
    **-\>** disproportionately hurt rural workers **-\>** rural workers
    can be extremist because of this

**Systems of Government**

-   Democracy can exist outside of these three conditions if the
    underlying social conditions favor democracy. But, others argue that
    2 party system, proportional representation, and federalism are
    needed for democratic systems

-   Communism and nationalism are contemporary challenges to democratic
    systems
