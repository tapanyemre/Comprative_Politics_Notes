# Long Summary



Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the
Making of the Modern World (1966).

Barrington Moore (1913-2005) taught at UChicago, Harvard, and then got
emeritus status in 1979 (over 40 years ago) according to Wikipedia.

**Chapters in a nutshell**: Moore's argument on democratization focuses
on one specific process of modernization: the transition from an
agricultural to industrial society. For Moore, democratization is
dependent on which coalition leads this transition effort. He creates a
three set typology to explain different modernization coalitions and
their corresponding regime type.

1.  If the transition to an industrial society is led by a middle-class,
    democratic political institutions will emerge. Moore uses the U.S.,
    England, and France as examples of this.

2.  If the transition is led by the peasant class alone, like in Russia
    and China, the conditions for a peasant revolution become ripe,
    which ultimately results in a modernization effort led by a
    communiist elite.

3.  If the modernization process is led by a marriage between the landed
    elite class and a strong central government, as in Germany and
    Japan, a dictatorship will ensue.

Put it simply, "No bourgeoise, no democracy" as Moore states.

**Sorry, I've given up on Barrington so just stick to the summary
above**

Chapter 1: England and the contribution of violence to gradualism

-   Examining the process of agricultural transition in England,
    providing a historical account of change

-   Those who promoted the wave of agrarian capitalism, the chief
    victors in the struggle against the old order, came from the
    yeomanry ([men who held and cultivated small landed estates)]{.mark}
    and even more from the landed upper classes (p 11)

-   The main victims of progress were as usual the ordinary peasants
    (11)

-   This in England the chief carriers of what was eventually to be a
    modern and secular society were at this time fundamentally mean of
    commerce in both the countryside and the towns.

-   The strong commercial tone in the life of the landed upper classes,
    both gentry and titled nobility, also meant that there was no solid
    phalanx of aristocratic opposition to the advance of industry
    itself\...the most influential sector of the landed upper classes
    acted as a political advance guard for the commercial and industrial
    capitalism

-   Destruction of the peasantry resulted in a peaceful democratic
    change (as much as the strengthening of Parliament after the civil
    war)

Chapter 3: America

-   He's making some bold claims here so there's a lot of stuff to
    critique (i.e. the Civil War was necessary for American democracy)

Chapter 6: India

-   It's very cool that he offers some prediction (even though it's
    wrong)

Chapter 7: Wrap up

-   Nice summary check out
