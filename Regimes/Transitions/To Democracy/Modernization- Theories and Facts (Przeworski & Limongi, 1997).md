#### First Summary

Adam Przeworski and Fernando Limongi, Modernization: Theories and Facts

World Politics, Vol. 49, No. 2 (Jan., 1997), pp. 155-183

Notes: Tim

Why do political regimes rise, endure, and fall? Does democracy lead to
economic development, or does economic development lead to democracy?

Possible Answers :

1.  Lipset (1959) suggested that economic development is a necessary
    precondition to democracy. Very strong relationship for 77 percent
    of cases. Two explanations:

    a.  Endogenous: As countries develop, democracies emerge

        i.  Modernization theory, where democratization is the final
            stage of modernization

        ii. Causal chain includes industrialization, urbanization,
            education, communication, mobilization, political
            incorporation, ect.

        iii. Democracy would be endogenous because it results from
             economic growth within the country during authoritarian
             rule.

        iv. If dictatorships fall randomly, then democracy would emerge
            more in affluent states. It survives if country is modern,
            but not as a product of modernization.

    b.  Test: If country develops over long period under dictatorship -
        will it embrace democracy? Only 19 dictatorships developed over
        long periods of time and reached modernity.

        i.  Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, South Korea, and Greece
            are ideal cases.

        ii. Based on reaching a critical threshold of income, Uruguay
            and Poland should never returned to dictatorship → they
            should have become democracies early.

        iii. What about Taiwan, which most likely democratized for
             geopolitical reasons, not economic ones?

    c.  Exogenous: Democracy might just be better able to last in
        economically developed countries; development might not actually
        help democracy.

        i.  Conclusion: There are no grounds to believe that economic
            development breeds democracies. Once established, while
            democracy is fragile in poor countries, it is impregnable in
            rich ones.

    d.  Lipset thought countries that industrialized/grew faster would
        destabilize faster. He was wrong.

        i.  Instead, poor countries are really fragile in the face of
            economic crisis

        ii. In the 252 years during which wealthy democracies
            experienced economic crises, none ever fell.

        iii. Economic crises, not growth, destabilize regimes

    e.  **Huntington and O'Donnell thought that beyond a certain
        threshold, further development decreases probability that
        democracy survives.**

> **Pretty rare. The richer the country, the more likely it is to
> sustain democracy, except in Argentina.**

f.  Do these likelihoods change depending on the time period, or does
    history repeat itself?

    i.  Comparing the new and old countries shows that democracies are
        more brittle in new countries while dictatorships are more
        likely to die in the old ones.

    ii. **Something powerful happened between pre WWI (old) and post WWI
        (new) regimes.**

    iii. Among countries that became independent after 1950,
         dictatorships are as stable when they are wealthy as when they
         are poor.

    iv. While development decreases the probability of survival of
        dictatorships in old countries, development decreases the
        probability of democratic transition in new countries.

Summary:

-   Democracy is not a by-product of economic development

-   Only once it is established, economic constraints play a role

-   You don't need to support dictatorships so that they'll develop and
    eventually democratize. You can just support democracy, and then
    help them develop.

-   "Common sense would indicate that in order to strengthen democracy,
    we should strengthen democracy, not support dictatorships."


#### Second Summary

Przeworski, Adam and Fernando Limongi. 1997. "Modernization: Theories
and facts." *World Politics* 49 (2):155-183

*Most of this is directly from the text*

The purpose of this article is to distinguish two theories (Lipset's
endogenous and exogenous theories) that relate economic development and
democracy and to examine some facts in light of them. Deliberately
ignores factors such as religion, colonial legacy, position in the world
system, income distribution, or diffusion, which have been found by
others to influence the incidence of democracy.

**Key Takeaways:**

-   ﻿The endogenous explanation is a "modernization" theory. The basic
    assumption of this theory, in any of its versions, it that there is
    one general process of which democratization is but the final stage.

-   Modernization consists of a gradual differentiation and
    specialization of social structures that culminates in a separation
    of political structures from other structures and makes democracy
    possible.

-   The specific causal chains consist of sequences of
    industrialization, urbanization, education, communication,
    mobilization, and political incorporation, among innumerable others:
    a progressive accumulation of social changes that ready a society to
    proceed to its culmination, democratization.

-   If the theory that democracy emerges as a result of economic
    development is true, transitions to democracy would be more likely
    when authoritarian regimes reach higher levels of development.

-   Dictatorships exhibit a "bell shaped pattern of instability"
    according to the endogenous explanation.

-   Few authoritarian regimes satisfy the premise of modernization
    theory; that is, few developed over a long period. And even if most
    of those that did develop eventually became democracies, no level of
    income predicts when that would occur.

-   The probability that democracy survives increases monotonically with
    per capita income.

-   Per capita income is a good predictor of the stability of
    democracies

-   In poor countries the value of becoming a dictator is greater and
    the accumulated cost of destroying capital stock is lower.

-   In wealthy countries by contrast, the gain from getting all rather
    than a part of total income is smaller and the recuperation from
    destruction is slower. Hence, struggle for dictatorship is more
    attractive in poorer countries.

-   These observations strongly confirm the exogenous version of
    Lipset's theory. Once democracy is established, the more well-to-do
    a nation, the more likely that it will survive.

-   The emergence of democracy is not a by-product of economic
    development.

-   Democracy is or is not established by political actors pursuing
    their goals, and it can be initiated at any level of development.

-   Only once it is established do economic constraints play a role: the
    chances for the survival of democracy are greater when the country
    is richer.
