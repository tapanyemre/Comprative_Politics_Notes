# Long Summary


Wantchekon, Leonard. 2004. "The paradox of "warlord" democracy: A
theoretical investigation." *American Political Science Review* 98
(1):2004.

*Most of this is directly from the text*

The author shoes that democracy can arise directly from anarchy.
Predatory warring factions choose the citizenry and democratic
procedures over a Leviathan when (1) their economic interests depend on
productive investment by the citizens, (2) citizens' political
preferences ensure that power allocation will be less biased under
democracy than under a Leviathan, and (3) there is an external agency
(e.g. the United Nations) that mediates and supervises joint disbarment
and state-building. Ultimately, the author discusses the implications of
this argument for the basic intuitions of classical political theory and
contemporary social theory regarding democratization and
authoritarianism.

**Key Takeaways:**

-   ï»¿Post-civil war democratization is particularly puzzling because it
    occurs in a context in which most political theorists not only
    predict but also recommend dictatorships

-   Presents a theory of democracy as an arbitration mechanism that
    stands as a solution to the Kantian paradox of a republican
    constitution framed by "a multitude of rational beings" without
    moral commitments to democratic values. Aims to offer a theory of
    post-civil war democratization

-   The liberal element in post-civil war democratization stems
    essentially from its promise of protection of citizens' rights to
    property

-   Describes the strategic situation created by civil war. Presents the
    players and their strategies and predicts the equilibrium outcome of
    their strategic interaction

-   An equilibrium in the game is defined as the strategy profile that
    is self-enforcing, in which no player can gain by choosing another
    strategy

-   The key players of the game are two warring factions and the
    citizenry

-   While warring factions are motivated by power, citizens are
    motivated by security concerns

-   The citizenry is divided into two groups: those affiliated with one
    of the two factions, such as political supporters or political
    activists, and the rest, who are not affiliated with either factions

-   The affiliated citizens are protected and enjoy the full benefit of
    their investment, while the nonaffiliated citizens are not protected
    and can be expropriated by warlords

-   Two warring factions have been involved in a costly and inconclusive
    conflict for control

-   The stalemate has led factions to consider the possibility of
    signing a peace agreement and creating a new government

-   Factions decide to call upon an independent third party to arbitrate
    (Leviathan)

-   Three stages to the game: 1: two factions simultaneously choose
    whether to invite Leviathan, democratize, or maintain status quo
    (stage one is unlikely) 2: Invite Leviathan for a price that will
    create a new government, eliminate illegal expropriation, and uphold
    authoritarian rule of law. External enforcer taxes citizens and
    decides which factions will constitute the government. 3: Same as 2
    but Leviathan establishes a power-sharing government that would draw
    resources from both factions resulting in less expropriation under
    democracy.

-   If parties can commit to lowering the level of expropriation, then
    citizens will work harder and invest mores. This leads to a
    threshold probability: q\* that is less than one-half, such that,
    whenever the factions think that they have at least q\* chance of
    winning the election, they will choose to democratize

-   Uses El Salvador as an example

-   Democratization can be forced by the economic cost associated with a
    breakdown of civil order. The rationale for democratization stems in
    part from its ability to generate the rule of law as a by-product
