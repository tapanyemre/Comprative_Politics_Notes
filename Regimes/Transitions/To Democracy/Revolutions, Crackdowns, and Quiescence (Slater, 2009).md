Summary (Tim)

Q. Who mobilizes against authoritarianism, and why?

-   Why do some authoritarian states see groundswells of opposition
    while others don't?

-   Why do some succeed while others fail? Which groups are key to their
    success?

A. Democratic uprisings are more likely to emerge and succeed when
communal elites oppose the regime.

-   For this to happen, elites must have gained "political salience" and
    retained political autonomy through long-term political development.

Critique of the literature:

-   "While political scientists and sociologists have paid considerable
    attention to the importance of social forces in laying the
    structural groundwork for democracy, we have places less stress on
    the causal mechanisms through which social forces actually turn
    nondemocracies into democracies" (205).

-   Literature also underemphasizes the importance of "collective
    identities" while overemphasizing social classes in regime change.

Conditions: (Frames his argument with several conditions in mind)

-   Theory of democratic mobilization, not democratic transition

-   Theory of challengers to the regime, not incumbents.

-   Bridges culturalist with 'comparative' (by which I think he means
    'institutionalist') perspectives.

Division of labor in study of democratization

-   Structure studies, examining societal and coalitional shifts

-   Contingency studies, examining short term dynamics when
    authoritarian regimes split and collapse

-   Missing: long term sociopolitical process that shape authoritarian
    regimes' end game dynamics when they find themselves in trouble.

-   "Do Singaporean, Malaysian, and Vietnamese democracy activists lack
    the "inventiveness" of their Indonesian, Philippine, and Thai
    counterparts? Or might there be underlying features of these states
    and societies as they have politically developed over time that make
    some of them more prone and primed for mass urban protest than
    others?" (216)

-   We should be asking *who* *mobilizes* as a starting point.

\[This is absurd. There is a nearly 20 page literature review. It merely
explains what has already been stated.\]

**Symbolic power**

Three types of power (a la Etzioni 1961): coercive, remunerative, and
symbolic.

-   Authoritarian regimes command coercive and remunerative power.

-   Opposition movements command symbolic power.

    -   They can generate symbolic power by 'framing' the struggle for
        regime change in ways that resonate with a broad cross-section
        of the population.

    -   Or, a leader can use charisma to connect a group with the goal
        the leader represents.

    -   This perspective ignores long term process of political
        development, and variation in power and agency.

**Communal Elites' Credentials**

-   Communal elites develop nationalist and religious credentials,
    cultivated over time.

-   Stem from formal, often path dependent institutions

-   These credentials allow them to achieve a symbolic advantage over
    authoritarian regime.

**Ways of Forging Credentials/Symbolic Authority**

-   Forged during High colonialism (1990-1945) and national
    decolonization (post wwII), endure under authoritarian rule
    (1955-1970), and then emerge politically autonomous. If they remain
    autonomous and structurally available when democratic opposition
    strikes during the Third Wave of democratization (1975-present),
    then their symbolic authority matters.

**Dynastic Rulers** - must have avoided colonial emasculation

**Religious Notables** - must have been a hegemonic national religion

**Nationalist leaders** - must have been part of a struggle for
independence during decolonization

If so, they become politically salient communal elites; if they didn't
found the authoritarian regime itself, they can remain politically
autonomous communal elites.

**The literature has not paid enough attention to the role of religious
and nationalist leaders in sustaining or undermining authoritarian
regimes.**


**(This kind of table, especially if you can produce \~10 more cases, is
fittable for QCA)**

**Medium-N Comparative Case Studies:**

-   Instead of choosing only cases where his desired outcome occurs
    (Thailand), he chooses the entire universe of cases in his region to
    show variation in those outcomes, and how that variation depends on
    a few factors.

**Symbolic Advantage and Democratic Revolution: Philippines**

-   **Overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos in Feb. 1986**

<!-- -->

-   Economic and electoral grievances present in the People Power
    movement, but these didn't motivate activists to risk life or limb.
    Why did citizens from all social classes take these risks for no
    clear or immediate personal benefit?

-   People Power movement exhibited religious atmosphere of a citywide
    Sunday Mass. State \~90% Catholic.

-   Relied on symbol of Jose Rizal, a nationalist/religious martyr from
    anti-Spanish uprising in 1896 ("a Tagalog Christ")

-   Catholic Church preserved political autonomy throughout Marcos years

-   In 1983, Marcos had Benigno Aquino, opposition leader, gunned down
    in front of international journalists to exhibit control over the
    state. Public identified Aquino with Jose Rizal. 250 major
    demonstrates followed in the next six months, with weekly
    demonstrations of tens of thousands until late 1985.

-   Aquino, his widow, Corazon, assumed leadership of anti-Marco forces,
    attempted a coup after Marcos was exposed to be defrauding the
    election. The coup failed, but Archbishop Cardinal Sin called the
    masses out by Vertias Radio to protect rebels.

-   Marcos ordered military to kill/break up the protests, but it
    required General Tadiar to shoot *nuns* at the front line, and he
    said *hell no.*

**Symbolic Disadvantage and Chronic Quiescence: Vietnam**

-   Royalty destroyed by French; Mahayana Buddhism was at mercy of
    Nguyen Court; no temple could be built without its permission.
    Deprived Vietnam of a unifying national religion that facilitated
    collective protest in Philippines and Burma.

-   Ho Chi Minh revolted against Japanese, took power, left power in
    1969, and was pretty much the only one with sufficient nationalist
    credentials to launch a movement; Vietnamese Communist Party kept
    his credentials and made it difficult for opponents to mobilize a
    challenge to single-party rule.

-   Neither economic downturn nor development has disloged VCP since.

**Symbolic Deadlock and Authoritarian Crackdown: Burma**

-   British destroyed Burma's Konbaung dynasty - no dynastic rulers left

-   Buddhism remained the hegemonic national religion. Monks at
    forefront of 1930s and 1945 nationalist movement. Students adopted
    peace-style resistance, were martyred for it.

-   Ever since, Buddhist clergy played significant role in periodic
    urban uprsiings.

-   Students and Buddhists repeatedly hold protests, but power not on
    their side. Aung Suu Kyi, daughter of Aung San (martyred
    student-leader), lended her legitimacy to the movement. Eventually,
    they managed a transition from the Military Junta to a new regime -
    marred by its own problems.

**Communal Elites and Democratic Mobilization Beyond South East Asia**

-   China: use of Goddess of Democracy in Tiananmen Square; prostration
    of protestors before sites of power to generate support and deflect
    states' coercive power, use of symbols, petitioning to government
    directly in the one place where they were historically permitted to,
    etc.

-   However, Chinese state commands powerful nationalist mission -
    whereas Philippines or Burma does not. This might be why it has
    persisted so long.

**Recommendation for Scholars:**

-   More ethnographic digging into how communal elites generate their
    mobilizational effect.

-   Disaggregation of role of nationalist vs. religious solidarities in
    democratic protest.
