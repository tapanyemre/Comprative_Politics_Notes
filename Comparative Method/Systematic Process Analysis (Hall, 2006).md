# Long Summary

**Systematic Process Analysis**

**Peter A. Hall**

-   **Main goal**: exploring the value of a method of systematic process
    analysis that can be applied in a small number of cases and provide
    valuable causal explanation in social science

-   **Main argument:** systematic process analysis has special value for
    developing theory-oriented explanations

1.  **Modes of explanation in social science:**

-   Puzzle: "In what does causal explanation for a social phenomenon
    exist?"

-   Author's assumption: identifying a set of variables (x1, x2, ...)
    (value can vary over time), that have some sort of causal impact on
    a set of outcomes

-   Researchers will wonder why those variables have set/specific
    outcome → what is a good causal explanation

-   The author goes through the three modes of explanation

    -   **1) historically specific:**

        -   explain a specific event or a small amount of events with
            limited n

        -   Events are product of long chain of other events

        -   Goal of historian: find the whole chain impacting specific
            outcome, establishing why it was likely to occur, but also
            why at that time and that place

        -   Will eventually identify a list of variables in terms of
            their priority

    -   **2) Multivariate explanation:**

        -   Goal: identify the causal factors (a small set of variables)
            conducive to a broad class of events, estimate magnitude of
            the effect of each variable and the confidence with which we
            can assert its effect; therefore good explanations are
            parsimonious; tends to favor statistical modes of inquiry

    -   **3) Theory-oriented explanation:**

        -   Goal: interpreting the task of explanation as one of
            explaining and testing a theory which names key determinants
            of broad class of outcomes; it adds special importance to
            specifying the mechanism how those determinants are relevant
            to the outcome → identify the key elements in the causal
            chain generating a certain type (class) of outcomes,

        -   More sympathizing with critical realism than nomological
            approach (multivariate expl)

**2. Choosing a Research Design and Method:**

-   Any method chosen depends on the mode of explanation used for
    research

-   Explanation depends on what sorts of outcomes we look at

-   It also depends on how we perceive the world

-   And on what general ideas we have on the causal relationship to the
    outcome (observation, existing studies, intuition)

-   Author argues that there is no single method superior to assessing
    the validity of causal inference

**3. The value of Small-N research design:**

-   Author basically makes a play for political scientists to appreciate
    the small N

-   Political scientists seem to like the large N as it (duh) provides
    more cases, gives us more freedoms, and increases the chances to
    include all necessary variables for the explanatory aspect of the
    outcome

-   However, sometimes there are areas in our field that just don't
    apply to large N (maybe not everything truly quantifiable or at
    least it distorts reality to such a point that it doesn't make
    sense)

-   He uses examples of rational choice models of political behavior or
    path dependent models of polity as not conducive with a statistical
    method

-   Supposedly, dislike towards small N also comes from a "negative
    association" with comparative method, which is seen as the
    statistical method acting small, emphasis on correlation

-   If seen this way than obvious that that's not a great method,
    because it limits the freedom of considering many causal variables
    responsible for a certain outcome

-   If perspective changed though, and small N more viewed as "terrain
    for process tracing" where the causal chains is looked at from many
    different sides → perfect for assessing complex causal theories,
    which are now more prominent in our field

-   If his method of "systematic process analysis" is applied, small N
    valuable for testing causal relationship

**4. The Method of Systematic Process Analysis:**

-   The author explains how a researcher creates theories - basically:
    "no matter how novel" it's based on previous research/observation
    etc.

-   However, and the author stresses that point, any good researcher
    should approach a problem not just with one principal theory but
    with an array of theories, which are then tested against one another
    ("facts" are inadvertently created through a theory, therefore need
    multiple theories)

-   Calls it: three-cornered fight: a theory, a rival theory, and a set
    of empirical observations

-   *Deriving predictions*

    -   For each theory, predictions made about patterns if theory
        false/correct

    -   Making predictions that are consistent with one theory, but
        inconsistent with its rival, in order to observe which of
        theories more valid

-   *Making observations:*

    -   The author defines a case as a unit in which the relevant
        outcome takes on a specific value (310) (i.e. region, nation,
        organization at a point in time)

    -   Observation is a piece of date acquired through appropriate
        method of research

    -   Strength of the author's method: it allows multiplicity of the
        observations and tests of the theory (310)

    -   Usual comparative method only focuses on outcome and some key
        variables; this method has also predictions on the process by
        which an outcome is caused, which also functions as a test of
        theory

    -   The goal is to see whether if multiple actions and statements by
        the actors at each of the individual process stages are
        consistent with the image of the world that the theory implies.

-   *Drawing conclusions*:

    -   Comparing your observations with the theories → judge whether
        theories have merit

    -   To increase validity, observations should be compared also to
        main rival theory

**5. An example: (John) Owen on the Democratic Peace**

-   Here the author applies the above mentioned parts of an
    investigation (as he calls it) to a real life case, which highlights
    the effectiveness of systematic process analysis

-   Inspired by Kant's perpetual peace theory

    -   Most studies to investigate the validity of the claim that
        democracies don't go to war against each other are of large N

    -   Cases available for examination are quite limited, leave open
        the actual status of the causal claim → hard to dismiss rival
        theories

-   Owen's approach: *formulating a theory about the causal mechanism
    that lead democracies to be reluctant to attack other democracies
    and examining a set of cases to see whether such a causal mechanism
    operates in them* (312)

    -   Uses structural theories (institutional constraints on
        democracies) and normative theories (ideas in democracies)

    -   Identifies core set of operative ideals as liberal ones

    -   Links the two pathways

    -   His theory: both institutions and ideology of democracies flow
        from character of liberal ideas (312)

    -   Provides rationale for why each of the operative variables in
        the causal chain should have the effects he assumes (312)

    -   Uses historical documents of liberalism to show why key elements
        are plausible (312)

    -   Justification for plausibility of assumptions in causal model
        comes from observed cases and literature

    -   Then predictions made of what should be observed if theory
        correct and incorrect (creates six key hypotheses and other
        predictions for alternative theoretical approaches)

    -   Emphasis of predictions lies on attitudes liberals will have
        towards foreign states and actions they will take (313)

    -   Owen analyses 4 cases in which war between the US and another
        state was a possibility (2 it occured, 2 it didn't) → checks
        whether observations sort of match his theories → surprise,
        surprise: they broadly do

-   The author states that Owen used archival materials about the cases
    and also paid attention to the statements and perceptions of the
    actors themselves.

-   It is a crucial argument because his main argument is that liberals
    are more reluctant to go to war with states they viewed as liberal
    and the perceptions of whether an antagonist was liberal or not was
    not always impacted by the state's electoral institutions (313).

-   The author applauds Owen's balanced drawing of conclusions as he
    acknowledges some limitations in his broad theories but opens the
    door to more avenues to explore.

**6. Employing Systematic Process Analysis:**

-   Concluding remarks about this method.

-   The author acknowledges that for social scientists this approach is
    not revolutionary

-   He stresses, however, again that it is a great method if one wishes
    to move beyond the simple focus on outcomes and a limited set of
    explanatory variables.

-   This method should be used when a researcher seeks a theory-oriented
    mode of explanation.

-   It cannot produce precise parameter estimates that are reliable.

-   If the research requires, though, the inclusion of decisions and
    actions of key participants in an event, the research can determine
    how much various factors influenced the outcome - with more
    precision than a statistical analysis

-   When is it most useful to apply the systematic process analysis:

    -   When there is a broad agreement on the causal chain but a
        dispute about the impact of the individual factors

    -   When different process theories have been created to explain the
        same phenomenon

-   The author mentions an "analytic narrative"-approach created by
    Bates et al

    -   Shares some features with his method

        -   However: Bates' method does not pay much attention to
            testing rival theories against each other → one main theory
            derived and then modulated as the research process continues

-   Where possible systematic process analysis should be applied to
    multiple cases (not just one)

-   Might also be interesting to apply to cases where a certain outcome
    does not occur (additionally to those where it does occur) → both
    pieces useful for theory testing

-   To sum up: *systematic process analysis and small N research design
    work well together to find good causal inference (combining wealth
    of detail and securing more powerful grounds than simple comparative
    method)*
