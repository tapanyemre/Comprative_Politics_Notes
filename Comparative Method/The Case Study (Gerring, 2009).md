# Long Summary

**Central question**: Are case studies methodologically flawed, and if
so why do they persist? Should we keep them, change them, or get rid of
them?

Two/three kinds of research: *cross-case, case study, and within-case
research*

Several commonly cited problems with statistical cross case analysis
that lead people to use case studies:

1.  Difficulty adequately specifying the causal model, given
    interactions or unknown variables

2.  Adequately conceptualizing or identifying variables

3.  Extreme counterfactuals, as in difficulty explaining cases that
    deviate significantly from the general model

4.  Influential cases

5.  The arbitrariness of standard significance tests

6.  Misleading precision of point estimates in curve fitting

7.  finding appropriate estimators and modeling temporal autocorrelation
    in pooled time series (whatever that means)

8.  Identifying causal mechanisms

9.  Faulty data drawn from a variety of sources

Some more problems:

1)  Natural experiments, field experiments, and matching estimators
    better identify causal relationships

2)  New alternatives can also capture cross-case analysis, eg. QCA,
    optimal sequence matching

3)  New merging of rational choice and case studies in "analytic
    narratives"

4)  Causal analysis should pay attention to causal mechanisms, not just
    causal effects.

Case studies still viewed with extreme concern. How can we do them after
methodologically sound way?

Case: spatially defined phenomenon where unit observed at a single point
or period in time. Inference attempts to explain that phenomena.

Case study is intensive study of single or several cases in order to
understand a larger class of cases.

**What is a case study good for question case study versus cross case
analysis**

Case studies are good for generating new hypotheses.

-   Newton and the theory of gravity,

-   Levi Strauss and structuralist theory of human cultures based on
    several North and South American tribes.

-   Freud, human psychology based on a dozen clinical cases

-   Darwin

**Causal Insight: Causal Mechanisms versus Causal Effects**

Effect - magnitude of causal relationship

Mechanism - *how* x affects y, connected in a plausible fashion

-   Case studies allow us to see the causal mechanism, to peer into the
    black box. General relations are often discovered in vivo, that is,
    the field worker literally sees then occur

-   How subjects develop and implement their views

-   For many questions, there is simply too little data, or the causal
    mechanism is too complicated, for cross-case analysis to suffice

-   Sometimes, Causal Mechanisms are very clear and don\'t need explicit
    attention, so cross-case analysis much more fruitful than case study

**Scope of Perception: Deep or Broad**

-   Deep info - case study

-   Broad - when info is pretty consistent across cases, enough that
    they are comparable in cross-case studies

**Population of Cases: heterogeneous vs. homogeneous**

-   Case study research - relies on processes, multiple independent
    possible causal paths and outcomes (causal equifinality)

-   Using cross-case analysis on heterogeneous cases with multiple
    causal pathways leads to erroneous, or at least less-than-ideally
    specified model

-   Trade-off between observations (n) and variables (k)

-   Espeict matters whether the concept under study can be reliably
    measured (eg. Democracy, development, etc.)

**Causal Strength: Strong Versus Weak**

-   If strength of effect is large, easy to study with cross-case
    analysis

-   If strength of effect is small, cross-case analysis might not
    capture the effect (type in error)

-   Ergo, case study good for small, unique effects

-   Multiple types of relationships: deterministic (eg. Necessary and
    sufficient). A deterministic causal proposition can be disproved
    with a single case. Ergo, good for case study research.

-   Proving an invariant causal argument generally requires more cases.

> Magnitude and consistency/probablistic measurements better for
> cross-case analysis

**Useful Variation: Rare vs. Common**

Distribution of useful variation

-   If useful variation is rare, better for case study

-   If useful variation is plentiful, cross case

-   Eg. Just a few revolutions to study, then case study

**Data** **availability**

**Concentrated versus dispersed**
