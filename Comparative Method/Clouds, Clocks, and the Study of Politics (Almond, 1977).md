# Long Summary

#### Big questions: What are we doing?


       ​This article echoes Professor Kay’s class and the readings from it, so buckle up. The authors use Karl Popper’s (along with Braithwaite & Hempel) clouds-clocks continuum. Clouds being irregular, disorderly, unpredictable on one side and clocks being regular, orderly, and predictable on the other. Newtonian models of science affirm that “all clouds are clocks.” However, quantum theory development in the 1920s challenged the notion, saying “all clocks are clouds.” Popper argues that “indeterminism is not enough” to account for the autonomy of human ideas in a physical world. However, the world is not necessarily deterministic either otherwise it would be a “perfectly flawless clock.” So, chance must play some role, but “is chance more satisfactory than determinism?” Popper argues that there is something intermediate between perfect chance (clouds) and perfect determinism (clocks). He then concludes that the world is an “open system” of “plastic controls” that allows us to understand it rationally, but not fully; thus, the authors add, models of “explanation appropriate to physical science will not enable us to come to grips with human and cultural phenomena.” We can understand the phenomena but not truly explain them because of their “creative and emergent properties.”

       ​Almond and Genco argue that the “plastic controls” paradigm explains political reality best because behavioral repertories of people are not fixed and not clock like – people have memories, they learn, and they change goals and strategies which intervene between cause and effect, and between independent and dependent variable. Those who try to view and explain human behavior as “clocklike” are “trying to fashion a science based on empirically falsified presuppositions” that are based on plastic political regularities, not cast-iron regularities. For example, misunderstandings of voting behavior or socialization theories show how unstable political “regularities” are (see pp 494-495). The authors also use social mobilization theory as an example.

       ​Political science rests on three epistemological and methodological assumptions from hard science: (1) purpose of science is the discovery of regularities and ultimately laws, (2) scientific explanation means the deductive sub Sumption of individual events under covering laws, and (3) only scientifically relevant relationships between events in the world are those which correspond to a physicalistic conception of causal connection (see p 497). A focus on regularities ignore unique or low-probability events; so we must not delimit the scope of political science. A focus on a deductive-nomological model of covering laws loses usefulness when exceptions are introduced because then we cannot maintain that “all A’s are B’s” if we have to settle with “some A’s are B’s.” A focus on strict causality is tied directly into #2, and ignores exceptions. The three assumptions combined too closely resemble the clock model when politics is not “clocklike.”

       ​From pages 505 to 511, the authors detail the movement of the political science profession to the “clock model.” Essentially, political scientists wanted to cash in on the research funding gold rush made possible by advances in physics and biology. In order to win the funding, politics had to be made more science-like; this is evident in the push methodology at the expense of substance, the push toward increasing quantification, and the popularity of reductive (though parsimonious) rational-choice models. As a result, “political theory and philosophy, public law and administration, and descriptive institutional analysis” are no longer being effectively transmitted to younger generations. Pages 511 to 518 discuss advances in psychology and economics that have influenced the political science profession, and the recent troubles in those two professions: psychology has the problem of “generalization decay,” and economics has the problem of failing to deal with nonphysical aspects of the economic process (in other words, economics became more political).

       ​So what are the implications? John W. Bennett argues for a more anthropological approach. Duncan MacRae’s solution is the introduction of research and teaching departments of policy analysis and applied science. Almond and Genco themselves suggest a reshuffling of the “pecking order” of priorities and resource allocations; a shift away from imitating the hard sciences. “Knowledge of political substance in its institutional, historical, and philosophical aspects has to be re-established on an equal footing with sophisticated methodologies and reductionist knowledge in our programs of graduate training.” Social science requires its own philosophy “based on explanatory strategies, possibilities, and obligations appropriate to human and social reality.”
