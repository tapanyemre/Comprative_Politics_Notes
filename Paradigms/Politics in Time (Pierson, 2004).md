Politics in Time: History, Institutions, and Social Analysis

Notes: Tim Fraser

**Introduction:**

-   Comparison of traditional cook vs. trendy restaurant "Modern Social
    Scientist"

-   Modern Social Scientist insists that "as long as you have the
    correct ingredients \[variables\] and they are properly measured
    \[operationalized\], she insists, how, in what order, and for how
    long they are combined *makes no difference"* (1).

-   *Timing and sequencing greatly affects the significance of variables
    in political processes.*

    -   Marx, Tocqueville, Weber, Polanyi, and Schumpeter all adopted
        deeply historical approaches to social explanation.

-   Social science often pays a "very high price... when it ignores the
    profound temporal dimensions of real social processes" (2).

-   **Two examples: Carpenter (2001) and Ertman (1996)**

    -   Carpenter's (2001) *The Forging of Bureaucratic Autonomy*

        -   criticizes Principal-Agent theories of legislatures and
            bureaucracies, which suggest that congressional 'principals'
            use substantial political resources to get bureaucratic
            'agents' to comply.

        -   "Under the right conditions... bureaucrats were able over
            extended periods of time to enhance their reputations for
            innovativeness... and develop strong networks of support...
            \[such that\] Congress, facing pressure from below and
            deferring to the expertise of leading bureaucrats... asked
            for what the bureaucrats wanted" (3).

        -   The problem was that past scholars took a cross-sectional
            approach, not examining the "long-term causal chain" (3).

    -   Ertman (1996) argues that timing mattered to state building in
        Europe, because some states had access to different technologies
        when thrust into military conflict depending on the timing of
        that conflict.

        -   Technologies, eg. literacy, modern bureaucratic
            organization, evidence of 'tax farmings' drawbacks

        -   Eg. monarchs who relied on landlords to collect taxes from
            peasants faced challenges, because that system benefits
            landlords tremendously, but leaves the monarch financially
            at the landlords' mercy. This is because monarchs often had
            immediate needs for revenue, but could not always access
            that revenue.

-   Problematically, American social scientists' "historic turn" to
    studies of history relies on three motivations - and not the right
    ones.

1.  **History as study of past** - examines political histories of
    specific countries to gain empirical evidence, but doesn't gather
    ideas we can extrapolate to other cases.

2.  **History as hunt for illustrative material** - scholars search for
    a past illustration of a model they have already constructed,
    usually because they can't find a good one in the present day.
    Doesn't mean time has been adequately factored into their model.

3.  **History as site for generating more cases** - scholars search
    history for past cases to get up to a large-n dataset size to study
    rarely occurring phenomena.

-   Scholars should turn to history because social life unfolds over
    time, and real social processes have distinctly temporal dimensions.

-   BUT, "history matters" is a pretty weak explanation for the effect
    of timing. Need to develop and unify rigorous concepts of temporal
    processes: eg. path dependence, critical junctures, sequencing,
    events, duration, timing, unintended consequences, etc.

-   Goal should be to create "causal mechanisms" not theories (6)

-   **Time** can benefit both **rational choice theory** and
    **historical institutionalism**

    -   Better outline why some inherited institutions are 'stickier'
        than others

    -   What constitutes a rational action depends on the sequence of
        events leading up to it. Time can enhance rational choice
        theory.

-   **Structure:**

    -   **Chapter 1: Path Dependence:** "dynamics of self-reinforcing or
        positive feedback processes in a political system"

        -   Relates to Douglas North's view of institutions as setting
            the "rules of the game"

        -   Why begin with path dependence? Self-reinforcing processes
            are a key example of how time affects politics

        -   Path dependence also is an important theoretical counter to
            functionalism, which supposes (incorrectly, according to
            Pierson) that social arrangements can be explained in
            reference to to needs they address for the currently
            powerful.

    -   Chapter 2: Timing and Sequence: When A precedes B, the outcome
        will differ from when B precedes A. This is why **process
        tracing** is employed in lots of comparative politics studies.

    -   Eg. Ertman: Mass literacy preceding intense military competition
        matter for statebuilding.

**Chapter 1**

-   **Polya urn process**: urn containing two balls - black and red.
    Take out one boll randomly, then return it with another ball of the
    same color. Eventually, this process reaches equilibrium, where
    distribution settles on a stable outcome, but early on, the
    distribution can be dramatically altered depending on early moves.
    Highlights **positive feedback.**

**Positive Feedback has four characteristics (18)**

-   **Unpredictability** - many outcomes are possible

-   **Inflexibility -** the farther into the process, the harder it
    becomes to shift from one path to another. Policy lock-in.

-   **Nonergodicity** - accidental, small events early on are not noise
    but dramatically alter the trajectory

-   **Potential path-inefficiency** - the outcome that becomes
    established may be less effective than a forgone alternative would
    have been.

**Path dependence** is the result of positive feedback loops. Some
examples:

-   Lipset and Rokkan 1967 - European party systems

-   Collier and Collier 1991 - labor incorporation in Latin America

-   Ertman 1996 - Statebuilding in Europe

-   Hacker 1998 - Why US hasn't built a national health insurance
    program

-   Attributing large outcomes to large causes/events is not always
    right; sometimes, early, minor events can be more consequential.

-   Two key elements of politics revealed by Positive Feedback dynamics

    -   "The costs of switching from one alternative to another will, in
        certain social contexts, increase markedly over time" (19)

    -   It matters whether events occur during formative moments or
        during long periods of stasis reinforcing divergent paths.

**Path dependence (a definition)**

-   **"Dynamic processes involving positive feedback, which generate
    multiple possible outcomes depending on the particular sequence in
    which events unfold" (20)**

    -   **Involves self-reinforcement**

    -   **Trajectories are hard to reverse**

    -   **Refers to branching patterns of historical development.**

**Increasing Returns and Path Dependence Arguments in Economics**

-   Economics seeks to find equilibria, because it enhances
    predictability

-   However, last 20 years of research suggests that equilibria may be
    less fruitful. Instead, Nobel prize winning economist Douglass North
    focuses on increasing returns, where each increase in a particular
    activity leads to larger, rather than smaller benefits over time.

-   After initial positive feedback, technologies or policies can get
    locked in, and then increasing returns mean actors have strong
    incentives to continue to support the same policy.

    -   Eg. QWERTY keyboard, VHS, DOS/MAC, Model-T & Gas Engine

    -   Early on, if incentives for individual users of technology B are
        lower, they'll gravitate to technology A, even if in the future,
        technology B has way higher payoffs for everyone. For further
        reading, see: ENERGY POLICY.

-   Four features of technology can generate increasing returns (Arthur,
    1994)

    -   Large set-up or fixed costs

    -   Learning effects - with repetition, individuals learn to use
        product more effectively, spurring further innovation in the
        product as opposed to alternatives)

    -   Coordination effects - benefits to individuals increase as more
        adopt the same option (positive network externalities) - eg.
        Facebook, Vaccines.

    -   Adaptive expectations - projections about future group use
        patterns lead individuals to adapt their actions in ways that
        help make those expectations come true. Self-fulfilling
        prophecies.

-   Path dependence especially relevant to economic/political
    *geography* - location of policy/products in space, over time.

    -   Eg. cluster of costume jewelry firms in PRovidence, RI

    -   Concentration of 60 million people in Northeast Corridor

    -   Explosion of trade between companies in the global north -
        extensive exchange within particular industries. Why have
        broadly similar countries developed highly specialized niche
        comparative advantages? Knowledge-intensive sectors prone to
        positive feedback. Countries with a lead in that niche
        consolidate that lead over time. High specialization. Countries
        with similar endowments develop different areas of economic
        strength

    -   Boom in Post-WWII growth in developed countries, more than labor
        and capital could explain. Multiple companies adopting the same
        new idea increase specialization, product improvement, and
        market growth.

    -   Also called **Interdependent web of an institutional matrix**
        (North 1990, 95)

    -   Individuals and orgs adapt to existing institutions. If
        institutional matrix creates incentives for piracy, then people
        (all people in the matrix) will invest in becoming good pirates.

**Critiques and Rebuttals:**

-   Only remediable path dependence is theoretically significant,
    because otherwise, there's nothing we can do about it. If no
    feasible improvements in the path, either now or in the past then
    "non-remediable path dependence" (Liebowitz and Margolis 1995). ""If
    we acted as best we could with the information available at the
    time, then the mistake was unavoidable, and we cannot reasonably
    describe the outcome as inefficient" (28).

    -   But that's what everyone thinks about their own actions

-   For policy purposes, you should definitely clarify if path
    dependence is remediable - otherwise, it's not very useful
    immediately. But for theory, of course it still matters even if we
    can't fix it. Or even for policymaking, what if it happens again?
    (Eg. Resilience)

-   Some claim remediable path dependence is rare and ill suited, but
    these critiques focus only on decision of firms to invest in
    specific technologies, and they don't consider the path-dependent
    institutions that support those markets.

**Sources of Positive Feedback in Politics:**

-   Four aspects of social life conduce to positive feedback:

1.  Collective action (eg. Putnam's case study of Italian Civil Society)

    a.  Politics is **compulsory**, not **voluntary -** eg you have to
        pay taxes b/c of legally binding rules, authority, coercion,
        etc.

    b.  Provides public goods distinguished by:

        i.  **Jointness of supply** - cost only modestly affected by
            number of those consuming it

        ii. **Nonexcludability** - Hard to limit consumption to those
            who have paid for a good

    c.  While in economic markets, you can move around labor market;
        competitive options set clear limits on how annoying your boss
        can afford to be, but in politics, consequences of my actions
        depend on actions of others. Strong tendency to free ride a la
        Mancur Olson's logic of collective action (1965).

    d.  Collective action in politics lacks linear relationship between
        effort and effect. Political mobilization tends to have a
        pattern where groups face positive feedback to become frozen
        party systems over time.

2.  High density of institutions

    a.  Policies are remarkably durable, meaning that over time, the
        density of institutions increases.

3.  Using political authority to enhance asymmetries of power

    a.  Actors use their authority to tweak the rules and enhance their
        power.

        i.  Eg. Nazis

        ii. Eg. Labour party in Britain in early 20th century

        iii. Eg. Disenfranchisement of African Americans in
             reconstruction era South

        iv. Positive feedback over time increases asymmetries of power,
            but those power relations may become more fixed and their
            causal institutions more invisible over time.

4.  Complexity and opacity

    a.  Learning happens in politics, but learning is very difficult and
        cannot be assumed to occur. The understandings of the political
        world should themselves be seen as susceptible to path
        dependence (eg. neoliberalism in policy, realism in IR)

    b.  Norms, cultural worldviews, and simple actions get reinforced
        each time they are performed

**Mechanisms for Reversing Course**

-   Economists think competition and learning are key to escaping
    problematic paths, but with large organizations (eg. politics),
    efficient structures do not always replace ineffecient ones.

-   Long movement down one path will increase the costs of switching to
    some previously forgone alternative.

**Two obstacles:**

-   **Short time horizons of political actors**

    -   If politician is coming up for reelection, short term policies
        matter a lot to them, while long term policies may matter little
        to them, because they might benefit themselves, or they might
        benefit potential competitors or replacements

-   **Strong Status Quo of Decision Rules governing Institutions**

    -   Institutions are designed to be sticky/change-resistant because:

1.  In order to bind those persons' successors

2.  In order to bind themselves (to achieve another goal)

-   An economy grows faster if monarch commits themself to refrain from
    expropriating and excessive amount of citizens' wealth

-   Formal barriers to institutional reform are often very high, eg.
    EU's unanimity requirement or US Constitution ¾ states ratification

**Path Dependence and the study of politics**

-   Four features of self-reinforcing processes

1.  **Multiple equilibria** - multiple possible outcomes

2.  **Contingency -** small events at the right time have enduring
    consequences

3.  **Timing and Sequencing** - an event might have great consequence at
    the right time, but no effect if too late

4.  **Inertia** - Once a process has been established, positive feedback
    leads to equilibrium in one outcome, eventually becoming resistant
    to change.

Path dependence doesn't need to be account for to measure all things. If
your goal is to understand something right now - eg. the magnetic charge
of the ship, it doesn't matter how it got the magnetic charge, just that
it is what it is right now.

-   Eg. "Historical causes" - where an event causes a state which
    continues perpetually, even if the event does not recur.

-   Differs from our understanding of independent effects, where if you
    remove X from the equation, Y should theoretically disappear.

-   But it's hard to know if X recurs to 'reinforce' path dependence.

-   "Where historical causation is at work, explanation requires the
    examination of considerable stretches of time" (46).

-   Path dependence basically invalidates functionalist arguments, that
    outcome X (an institution/policy) exists because it serves the
    function Y. Rather than assuming that, *we have to go back and
    look.*

-   Eg. Varieties of capitalism emerged not because some were more
    efficient in giving areas, but because they became ingrained in
    their institutional matricies.

**Remaining Concerns:**

-   **Old Wine in New Bottles?** No. We've known that events can be
    influential. Path dependence can help us learn *why* particular
    junctures are critical and *why* timing counts so much in politics.

-   **Are Path-Dependent Arguments just descriptive?** No. "The key, as
    Thelen suggests, is to specify the mechanisms that reinforce a
    particular path or trajectory. Without this, path-dependent
    arguments degenerate into little more than a description of
    stability" (49).

-   Example: Why do parties gain/lose power in US presidential
    elections? Because losing parties are relatively free to jettison
    unpopular policy positions and adopt more popular ones. Their future
    success *depends* on their failure.

-   **Contingency and Determinism:** Does this cede *too much*
    importance to early events and relegate all later events to the
    wastebin? No. Rigorous analysis will compare the effects of
    *multiple* small events on path dependence or transition, and leave
    open the door that subsequent critical junctures can feasibly change
    the trajectory - although it is hard to.

-   Example: "Hacker does not argue that the failure of the US to adopt
    national health insurance during the New Deal period was highly
    contingent \[on the US never adopting national health
    insurance\]\... This initial development generated powerful positive
    feedback, institutionalizing a set of private arrangements that made
    it *much* more difficult to make a transition to national health
    insurance at a later point in time" (52).

<!-- -->

-   No path is permanently "locked-in" - but we should understand the
    effects of events later on in the process as *different*. Probably
    weaker in some aspects.
