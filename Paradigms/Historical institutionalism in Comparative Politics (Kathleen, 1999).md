## Differences and similarities between Historical Institutionalism and Rational Choice Theory

**Introduction**

3 different types of "institutionalism": historical, rational choice,
and sociological

-   Historical institutionalism focuses on how institutions emergence
    and are embedded in concrete temporal processes

-   No strict borders among the 3 approaches

-   There has been crossovers between rational and historical
    institutionalism, and similarly between sociological and historical
    institutionalism

**Red Herrings and Real Issues**

[Theoretical versus Empirical work]{.underline}

-   Critics of RCT say it produces elegant theories but doesn't hold up
    empirically, while critics of historical institutionalism contend
    that scholars of HI are not building theory but merely "telling
    stories"

-   Author provides examples that counter both the critiques of HI
    (p. 372) and of RCT (373)

-   Thelen does concede key differences between HI and RCT in their
    approaches to theory building:

    -   HI engages in mid-range theory, which means focusing on a
        limited number of cases that are unified in space and time
        (example: democratic transition in Eastern Europe)

    -   HI work more from induction (observes empirical evidence and
        tries to build theory), while RCT is often a deductive process
        (starts with premises)

[Preferences: Problematic or Not]{.underline}

-   Author changed her mind on how stark the differences in preference
    formation are between RCT and HI

-   In reality, even in RCT the analyst needs to take into account
    cultural, institutional context to derive the preferences of actors

Micro-Foundational vs Macro-Historical research

-   Thelen contents this is also a false dichotomy, as in RCT one has to
    do empirical work to determine that actors identified were in fact
    players (macro), and in HI, one also often has to closely engage
    with individual actors that produce outcomes

Functional versus Historical view of Institutions

-   RCT embraces a functional view of institutions (how they shape
    strategic choices)

[Equilibrium versus Historical Process]{.underline}

-   RCT has assumptions of equilibrium and views institutions as
    coordinating mechanisms.

-   On the other hand, HI see institutions as legacies of historical
    processes

-   In HI, another important source of change comes from the
    interactions of different institutional orders within a society

-   HI examines politics as a dynamic process that creates often
    unintended consequences, as different, ongoing processes interact.

Path Dependency

[Technological Models of Path Dependency from Economics]{.underline}

-   Main argument from economics is that some technologies, for
    idiosyncratic and unpredictable reasons, can develop an advantage
    over others even if in the longer run other technologies would have
    been more efficient (ex: QWER keyboards, *railway gauges)*

-   "Positive effects" and increasing returns (Paul David-1985, and
    Arthur-1989)

-   Contrary to the technology model in economics, in politics
    increasing returns do not necessarily lead to locked-in equilibrium,
    and further choice points exist

## Progress HI in explaining institution formation and change 

Path Dependency in Historical Institutionalism

> Critical junctures: "crucial founding moments of institution formation
> that sends countries along broadly different paths of development"
> (p.387).

-   Strengths in how scholars have incorporated sequencing and timing
    into the analysis

-   Weaknesses in how they fail to explain the mechanisms that translate
    critical junctures into lasting political legacies

-   This is described as the "bread and butter" of HI

-   Examples of comparative historical studies that share a perspective
    of how processes unfold and affect each other

Feedback effects: The second approach suggests that institutions
continue to evolve in response to changing conditions and ongoing
political maneuvering but in ways that are constrained by past
trajectories

-   Strengths are in explaining the dynamic processes that explain how
    patterns persist and reproduce themselves over time.

-   Weaknesses: they don't tell us how these patterns can be changed or
    reversed

<!-- -->

-   Path dependent developments are sustained through positive,
    reinforcing effects (p. 392). What types of effects explain
    continuity?

    -   "Functional mechanisms", aka "coordinating effects": once a set
        of institutions is in place, actors adapt their strategies in
        ways that reflect but also reinforce the logic of the system
        (examples: vocational training and collective bargaining in
        Germany; "conservative-corporatist" welfare states and family
        structure; developmental state in Latin America; politics of
        deregulation in advanced industrial economies- ps.393 and 394)

    -   Distributional effects of institutions: institutions are not
        neutral coordinating mechanisms but in fact reflect, and also
        reproduce and magnify, particular patterns of power distribution
        in politics. Skocpol has a lot of work on this, explaining lack
        of working class alignment in the US to achieve better social
        policies (p. 395) Examples of petro-states,

Institutional Evolution and Political Change (p. 396)

-   Path dependent explanations are overly deterministic.

-   Instead, author argues for Orren & Skowronek's more dynamic
    alternative view, which focuses on the "incongruities and
    intersections between different processes and institutional logics
    as they unfold over time" (examples: war on poverty and civil rights
    movement)

-   Authors in this tradition use the same analytical tools to
    understand crucial moments and the mechanism that sustain patterns,
    to also identify moments of change, or where change is possible
