# Long Summary

Peter A. Hall and Rosemary Taylor: Political Science and the Three New
Institutionalisms (December 1996):

This article is a conference paper reviewing three types of 'new
institutionalism': historical institutionalism (HI), rational choice
institutionalism (RCI), and sociological institutionalism (SI)
\[Garrett: my own acronyms\]. The authors discuss the origins of each
type and what distinguishes them. Then they compare their strengths and
weakness, focusing on how they "construe the relationship between
institutions and behavior and how to explain the process whereby
institutions originate and change."

**Historical Institutionalism (HI)**

-   Developed in response to group theories and structural-functionalism
    of 1960s & '70s.

    -   From group theory, HI accepst that conflict among rival groups
        for scarce resources is the heart of politics and explain that
        the institutional organization of the polity and economic
        structures privilege some interests and demobilize others. HI
        expands which institutions matter and how.

    -   From structural-functionalism, HI is influenced by the view of
        polity as a system of interacting parts, but HI emphasizes the
        structural organization of the polity and economy, rather than
        the functional approach.

-   Neo-Marxist debate influenced HI development in 1970s, and led HI to
    look closely at the state not as a neutral broker among interests,
    but as a complex of institutions the structures the character and
    outcomes of group conflict.

-   HI definition of 'institutions': "The formal or informal procedures,
    routines, norms, and conventions embedded in the organizational
    structure of the polity or political economy."

    -   Can range from constitution order to standard operating
        procedure of bureaucracy to trade union behavior or bank-firm
        relations.

    -   Institutions are associated with organizations and rules or
        conventions promulgated by formal organization.

-   What distinguishes HI from RCI & SI? Four features:

    -   1\. Relationship between institutions and individual behavior is
        on broad terms

    -   2\. Emphasize power asymmetries associated with the operation
        and development of institutions

        -   HI emphasizes how institutions distribute power unevenly
            across social groups.

    -   3\. Emphasize path dependence and unintended consequences in the
        development of institutions

        -   "Institutions are seen as relatively persistent features of
            the historical landscape and one of the central factors
            pushing historical development along a set of 'paths.'"

        -   HI scholars try to focus on explaining how institutions
            produce paths -- i.e., how they structure a nation's
            response to new challenges

    -   4\. Concerned with integration of institutional analysis with
        other kinds of factors like ideas to create political outcomes

        -   HI seeks put institutions in a causal chain that includes
            socioeconomic development and the diffusion of ideas.

-   Relationship between individual behavior and institutions

    -   Two approaches: 'calculus' and 'cultural':

        -   Calculus: focus on behavior that is instrumental and based
            on calculation -- assumes goal maximization and strategic
            canvassing of possible options

            -   Institutions affect behavior in calculus approach by
                providing actors w/ greater or lesser degrees of
                certainty about present and future behavior of other
                actors -- institutions alter expectations

            -   Institutions persist because deviation world make an
                individual worse off than adherence would

        -   Cultural: Stress an individual's worldview -- does not deny
            rationality, but stresses boundedness -- individuals are
            satisficers not utility maximizers

            -   Institutions provide moral or cognitive template for
                interpreting the world and acting upon it

            -   Institutional persist because they are not explicit
                objects of individual choice -- they shape the structure
                of possible action

**Rational Choice Institutionalism (RCI)**

-   RCI arose from the study of American congressional behavior, seeking
    to answer the question of why Congressional outcomes are stable when
    conventional rational choice says that it should be difficult to
    secure stable majorities.

    -   The answer was institutions -- they provide rules and
        procedures, lower transaction costs, and solve many collective
        action problems

-   Four notable features of RCI:

    -   1\. Posits stable preferences and utility maximization

    -   2\. Politics are a series of collective action dilemmas (e.g.,
        tragedy of the commons, or the prisoner dilemma)

    -   3\. Emphasis on role of strategic interaction in the
        determination of political outcomes, and an actor's calculus
        will be affected by the actor's expectations about how others
        are likely to behave -- institutions reduce uncertainty
        regarding the actions of others

    -   4\. The process of institutional creation revolves around
        voluntary agreement of actors, and institutions survive because
        it provides more benefits than alternate institutions

**Sociological Institutionalism (SI)**

-   SI began in organizational theory near the end of 1970s as a
    challenge to Weberian sociology -- SI argued that institutional
    forms and procedures were not simply because they were most
    efficient for tasks at hand in some form of 'rationality.' Rather,
    the forms and procedures should be seen as culturally specific
    practices akin to myths and ceremonies, and assimilated into
    organizations, not in terms of means-ends efficiency, but as the
    result of the processes associated with the transmission of cultural
    practices.

    -   SI seeks to answer why organizations take on specific sets of
        institutional forms, procedures or symbols, and how such
        practices are diffused through organizational fields and
        nations.

-   Three distinct features:

    -   1\. Institutions are defined more broadly than in political
        science (rules, procedures, norms): they include symbols,
        cognitive scripts, and moral templates.

        -   Breaks down barrier between institutions and culture

        -   Challenges the line between 'institutional explanations'
            based on organizational structures and 'cultural
            explanations' based on understanding of culture

        -   Redefines cultural itself as institutions

    -   2\. Follows the cultural approach to behavior (see above) but
        emphasize 'cognitive dimension' of institutional impact --
        emphasis on how institutions influence behavior by providing
        cognitive scripts, categories, and models that are used for
        action and to interpret the world and behavior of others

        -   Institutions influence behavior of what one 'should' do but
            also of what one 'can' do in any given context

        -   Rational action itself is socially constituted

    -   3\. Organizations adopt new practices not because it advances
        means-end efficiency, but because it enhances social legitimacy
        of the organization and its participants.

**Comparing Institutionalism**

-   HI accommodates the calculus and cultural approach, but HI has
    devoted less time/attention to develop a more sophisticated
    understanding of how institutions affect behavior and identifying
    causal chains through the institutions they deem important.

    -   The authors recognize the importance of path dependence but
        complain that HI work is too inductive, and therefore slower to
        aggregate finders and create systematic theories of general
        processes for institutional creation and change.

-   RCI has developed a more precise conception of the relationship
    between institutions and behavior, but the generalizability rests on
    a simplistic image of human motivation.

    -   The authors believe this approach has real strength for
        explaining why institutions continue to exist and persist, but
        also say the approach is often highly functionalist,
        intentionalist, and/or voluntarist.

-   SI is better equipped to elucidate relations between institutions
    and action that may not be highly instrumental or well-modeled by
    RCI.

    -   The authors believe this approach can go a long way in
        explaining institutional inefficiencies, but that this approach
        often misses "the extent to which processes of institutional
        creation or reform entail a clash of power among actors with
        competing interests." The approach focuses on macro-level
        processes and can often look like 'action without agents.'

**Conclusion:** None of the 3 literatures seem to provide a wrong-headed
or substantially untrue account, but each often seems to only be
providing a partial account for the forces at work in a given situation
and capturing the different dimensions of human behavior and
institutional impact. If the theoretical assumptions of the 3 approaches
is relaxed, they share a great deal of analytical common ground on which
they may be able to supplement or strengthen each other. HI is at a
pivotal position and could be readily translated into RCI or SI.

They do not argue for crude synthesis, but "our main point is that,
after some years in which these schools of thought have incubated in
relative isolation from each other, the time has come for a more open
and extensive interchange among them. There is ample evidence that we
can learn from all of these schools of thought and that each has
something to learn from the others.
