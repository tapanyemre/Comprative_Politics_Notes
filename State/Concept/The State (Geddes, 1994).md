# Long Summary



**The State**

-   Change in understanding what the state actually does

-   Scholars have viewed the state as simply "reflecting outcomes caused
    by the struggle among private interests to secure policies
    beneficial to themselves" (2)

-   New understanding: governments act independently of underlying
    socioeconomic forces

-   **Therefore a need to explain the state's role in "bringing about
    change" (2)**

-   Scholars have made the fascinating discovery that **"states are loci
    of power, resources, and interests" (2)**

    -   State officials have interests/policy preferences that may not
        align with major social and economic groups

-   Policies reflect those → create incentives that shape day-to-day
    choices of individuals in society → affect rate of
    growth/distribution of benefits of growth/the way political,
    economic, and social system

-   This is just an introductory chapter to the rest of the book

*The state in economic development*

-   Why bother with an approach that specifically looks at the autonomy
    of the state?

-   Observations were made that showed that governments affect in some
    way major shifts in economic policy without the support of major
    interest groups (usually seen in "most successful new
    industrializing countries and also in what used to be considered
    successful post-revolutionary regimes" (2))

    -   Prior theoretical constructs (structural marxist, realism) in
        conflict paradigm could not explain policy shift.

    -   Expectations were not met, as strong interest groups lost
        conflicts

    -   Example: recent history in Latin American region, where
        industrialization policies damaged biggest interest groups
        dominating the economic sphere (i.e. agriculture and/or miming);
        domestic groups have failed to protect their interests

    -   Beneficiaries from these changes were usually initially weak,
        and only became strong due to the initiative of the state in
        change (i.e. Brazil's auto industry)

-   From observations like these social scientists inferred an existence
    of an autonomous force, which apparently seemed to depend on state
    resources and seemed to be guided by preferences of political
    leaders (because of ability to disregard injured parties)

    -   State autonomy cannot be directly observed

    -   Rather it explains a situation that appears odd if one were to
        assume that government policies generally reflect societal
        interests

    -   Because of inference hard to study and explain

        -   No one has confirmed empirically the existence of political
            or societal characteristics that allow governments to act
            autonomously (6)

        -   Therefore, focus on policy outcomes

        -   Nonetheless, literature attempts to explain why states
            intervene in economy and society

        -   Still relies mostly on observation

    -   Within statist literature two choices

        -   Systematic structural arguments

            -   Lack plausible individual level (usually treat state as
                rational unitary actors without building any plausible
                foundation for doing so, different preferences, societal
                interests, etc.)

        -   Plausible individual-level explanations

            -   Lack theoretical reach

    -   Another issue, most state autonomy arguments developed about
        authoritarian states, "trend" of democratization shifts those
        arguments again, as states still matter, but the arguments
        developed do not

*The state as a collection of self-interested individuals*

-   The author suggests a new approach at looking at state autonomy

-   Instead of looking at policy outcomes, one should apply a model of
    rationally self-interested political leaders

-   Focus on the individuals and the incentives they face

    -   It provides a systematic explanation for different capacities
        and preferences of different parts of the state

        -   Model assumes that bureaucrats and officials are rational
            beings attempting to maximize their career success

        -   Their decisions guided by the preference to stay in office
            as long as possible

        -   State decisions will reflect their interests, however the
            features of the state (its institutions) will demonstrate
            how best those interests can be accomplished

        -   Officials and politicians will behave in ways that result in
            state autonomy when it serves their own career interests to
            do so (8)

        -   Degrees of autonomy can be predicted from institutional
            features rather than inferred based on policy outcomes
            (allows falsifiability)

        -   The focus on incentives is according to the author,
            therefore, a better attempt at explaining policy outcomes
            than this "non-entity" of state autonomy (which is only
            possible if one knows state interests)

-   When speaking of autonomous behavior, usually what has been argued
    is that (i.e Theda Skocpol) that international threats motivate
    autonomous behavior (separated from the dominant classes)

-   Geddes' approach, however, shows that officials/politicians have
    great leeway in choosing how to respond to such a threat (response
    will reflect their own domestic interests)

-   Many failures in responding to international threats, so Geddes, can
    be attributed to leadership trying to address the crisis while also
    gaining an advantage with domestic rivals

-   An example of a policy trying to address an international economic
    threat and capturing domestic resources for political leaders are
    commodity marketing boards (CMB)

    -   CMB: designed to counteract the threat of foreign control over
        the marketing of export crops, while at the same time
        contributing to economic diversification as a means of reducing
        vulnerability to external price shocks → monopolis ove the
        marketing of export crops allowed governments to capture
        resources from agricultural sector to use in building industrial
        sector → resources spent on manufacturing and infrastructure
        projects could be directed towards regions that would benefit
        supporters of the leadership → helping to maintain the machinery
        of leaders (10)

    -   CMB worked in so far as they got money out of agri sector,
        didn't reduce economic vulnerability, farmers had reduced
        incentive to export, reducing export earnings

*How institutions shape incentives:*

-   Policy preferences and behavior shaped by institutions of the regime

<!-- -->

-   When classifying governments according to the incentives favoring
    autonomy that they provide officials → continuum

-   Leninist regime on one end of the spectrum (remarkable degree of
    autonomy from society) ... oligarchical democracies in undiversified
    economies on the other (politicans will depend their choices on
    dominant interest groups because only they matter)

-   Modern democratic regimes provide self-interested political leaders
    with reasons for autonomy from dominant groups (12)

    -   Reasons vary over time, across actors, across countries

    -   Variation can be explained by institutional differences among
        democracies

        -   → institutions shape what behavior will lead to career
            advancement

        -   By analyzing institutionally determined incentives facing
            political leaders, one can explain state action that might
            be unexpected from other traditional approaches (12)

-   The authors study (in this book) looks at the motivations and
    incentives of four types of political actors

    -   Presidents (looks mainly at Latin America, but goal is to
        complete term, then maximize future political power, reelection
        at some point)

    -   Legislators (career depends on reelection)

    -   Party leaders (maximize party power and their power within the
        party)

    -   State bureaucrats (security in office, advancement and material
        advantages)

-   Time horizon in Latin American countries limited, "discount future
    fairly heavily" due to high probability of military intervention

    -   → unstable environment forces short-term decisions that lead to
        quick results and immediate rewards

-   Moves away from assumption that the state itself is an actor with
    preferences and interests, which - again - according to the author
    explains better how states operate and act autonomously

*State capacity to initiate change:*

-   Implementation of decisions is just as important as making decisions
    in the first place

-   State capacity has received little attention in statist literature

-   Preferences of state actors mean little if they can't be enacted

-   Capacity to implement depends on "ability to tax, coerce, shape the
    incentives facing private actors, and make effective bureaucratic
    decisions during the course of implementation" (14)

    -   They all depend on existence of an effective bureaucratic
        organization

-   Little attention paid to how one achieves such competence in
    bureaucratic organization

-   Reforms don't usually work

-   In developing world these competences are rare

-   Geddes' study suggests that the development of bureaucratic
    competence also depends on individual political leaders and their
    goals

*The struggle over reforms to increase state capacity:*

-   Need for capacity happened simultaneously with perception of need
    for state intervention in the economy

-   Between WW2 and 1980 many governments came and went with bags full
    of great ideas on how to reform the system, didn't even face major
    oppositions, military supported state intervention to boost
    development

    -   And yet it didn't work

        -   Reasons: lack of experience, competence, expertise among
            personnel charged with carrying out those projects,
            diversion of needed funds, subversion of reform goals by
            politicians and bureaucrats uncommitted to their
            achievements → lack of state capacity to accomplish tasks in
            state-led change

-   Several studies exist describing the development of state capacity
    (see 16), which is conceived as expertise in government and
    emergence of consensus among political leaders regarding needed
    changes

    -   Do not provide an answer to when these changes will occur

    -   Analysts have ignored bureaucratic and administrative capacity

    -   Solely focus on the expertise part → which implies that lack of
        know-how is the key determining factor in effective state-led
        change

-   With the dilemma that some issues with clear solutions still remain
    unsolved, political interests as forces of opposing or impeding
    change came into the forefront

-   Political constraints are main issue hindering development

-   Geddes provides the example of the nationalization of Chilean copper
    mines (expertise was there, political consensus was there, technical
    capacity was there → an yet government mismanaged the mines after
    nationalization; the need for the president to consolidate political
    support overwhelmed the need for economic performance; inadequate
    people put into managerial positions in mines as exchange for
    political support)

-   Geddes calls it the politician's dilemma

-   Therefore, when analyzing autonomy and capacity one needs to look at
    the incentives facing the individual who are the decision makers
