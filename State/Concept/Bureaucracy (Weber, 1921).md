Weber's "Bureaucracy"

Summary

Question: How does 'modern officialdom'/government actually work? What
explains policy outcomes/successful, modern state governance? What
variables make bureaucratic governance work?

Answer: Bureaucratic structure allows the state to maximize efficiency
and organize its actors into one singular purpose. Key variables
include:

-   Position/appointment/tenure/independence of Officials

-   Compensation of officials

-   *Weber's view has been characterized as where we think institutions
    develop because they are the most efficient rule for the task at
    hand.* (Modern critique: What if they're not? Why do institutions
    change then?)

**Weber sees Bureaucracy as characterized by 3 elements**

-   Regular activities/official duties

-   Authority to command distributed in a structured, stable way

-   Methodical, regular fulfilment of duties

    -   Only employs capable professionals, not political appointees or
        inheritors

Bureaucracies are *agencies* in the state or *enterprises* in private
economy

-   Weber views them unique to the modern state

-   Monocratically organized - one purpose, not based on the wills of
    all the participants

-   Follows general rules, more or less stable

**Position of Officials**

-   Officials protected by rank; trained experts.

-   Depends on whether elected or appointed

    -   If elected, no longer a purely bureaucratic figure, because they
        have multiple allegiances, not just to enforcing the rules of
        the bureaucracy

    -   When officials are elected or selected based on public demand,
        it endangers these large bureaucracies, because they might
        perform poorly. Plus, it means the voters will probably hold the
        party/president in power accountable in the next election if
        they pick a bad cabinet.

    -   **Tenure for life/judicial independence** is not a guarantee or
        necessity in governance, but rather something that government
        give out so that officials can perform their jobs right. It's
        not like the immunity officials enjoyed in aristocratic regimes.

    -   **Fixed Career Lines** - bureaucratic structure tends to
        reinforce officials promotion over time into more protected and
        better paid positions, and this is distinct from political
        offices, where seniority matters less.

**Money and Funding**

-   Funding is necessary for the bureaucracy to do its job, because it
    entails that governments pay their officials to do their jobs. (As
    opposed to lords doing administrative roles out of duty or fear.)

-   Even without official monetary salaries, bureaucracies can come into
    formation and operation

    -   Eg. Egypt, Catholic Church, etc.

    -   Always involves compensation of some kind.

    -   Without fixed income, bureaucratic structures can't avoid
        undergoing changes.

    -   Tim note: Samurai (local government administrators in the Edo
        period who also happened to be trained warriors) were
        compensated in rice. (Which didn't work out for them in the late
        1800s when the value of rice plummeted, making the Samurai much
        poorer than the merchant class, who were compensated in coinage.
        Not efficiently compensated, the samurai stopped performing
        administrative duties for the Shogunate, and some feudal samurai
        clans revolted against the Shogunate in the Meiji Restoration
        of 1868. Ergo, compensation of officials directly affects
        bureaucratic governance.

-   **Tax-farming:** If no fixed compensation involved, then officials
    usually resort to tax-farming or office-farming, where they sell
    their resources/policy outputs to the highest bidder for personal
    gain. This kind of landlording was common in Feudal Russia, etc.
    Sometimes regimes even create regulations to make sure that the
    landlords reap only a sustainable amount of compensation from their
    subjects.

-   **Office-purchase**: Officials without fixed incomes will try to buy
    up additional offices or officials positions in order to generate
    more revenue for themselves, like little vassal states. Big
    mobs/yakuza groups work like this.

-   **Using status incentives instead of physical coercion:**
    Bureaucracy provide merit-based rewards for productivity rather than
    punishment for poor productivity. This incentivizes efficient
    bureaucracy.

-   Even if bureaucracy doesn't have fixed compensation for officials,
    they can still operate with tax-farming, office-purchase, or
    coercion, but they are more likely to change rapidly or face
    consequences unless they create rules to keep such farming
    sustainable and productive.

**Historical big states**: not all were bureaucracies.

-   Rome disintegrated in spite of bureaucratization right at its
    introduction.

-   Rome (and later England) did not fully bureaucratize because they
    were coastal empires. Only when Rome became a continental empire did
    it bureaucratize so that it could better operate large standing
    armies across huge tracks of land.

-   *The large modern state depends on bureaucracy. The larger the
    state, the greater its power, the more it needs to systematize its
    power structure in order to maintain its dominance.* (see p. 971).

<!-- -->

-   Calls US (at time of writing) not fully bureaucratized (federalism),
    but because the parties are very bureaucratic (eg. party bosses),
    the US was de-facto bureaucratized anyways.

**Highly technical tasks demand bureaucratization**

-   Provision of public goods, eg. railroad, waterways, roads.

    -   Eg. public regulation of water economy in Egypt led to
        bureaucratization

-   Orderly policing and protection

-   Always better at providing technical public goods than
    administration by nobles, because if the nobles hoard or tax-farm,
    the system doesn't provide public goods efficiently, the public
    reacts, and the system changes

-   **Relationship to law (Kadi Justice/ Common Law / Roman Law)**

    -   Bureaucracy necessitates rational, consistent law

    -   Can't function on ethical or informal judgements ("Kadi"
        justice)

    -   Eg. Common law advocates gained power over ecclesiastical law in
        Rome

    -   \[I honestly didn't understand much of this part.\]

-   **Concentration of Means of Administration:**

    -   Successful bureaucracies, eg. armies, concentrate power in
        military structure, reducing opportunities for subordination,
        clarifying rules, and reducing the number of independent
        decision makers. It's really important that the army include
        both the wealthy property owners and the poor non-property
        owners, and that power is not vested in the former. Also, having
        one army unified regardless of class means that specific
        landowners/landlords cannot have their own army units and no
        longer pose a military threat to the nations of which they are a
        part.

-   **Leveling of Social Differences**:

    -   "Bureaucracy inevitably accompanies modern *mass democracy*, in
        contrast to the democratic self-government of small homogenous
        units" (983).

    -   This isn't true, of course. China, Russia, and many other
        countries have created bureaucracy, but to be fair to Weber,
        they aren't always super efficient.

    -   Its because bureaucracy entails deconstructing privilege and
        making all participants equal (and equally subservient) to the
        bureaucratic system. All officials in it must be equally
        responsive to their supervisor, etc. in order for it to
        function. In some ways, bureaucratization can *advance*
        democracy - think Benedict Anderson and Indonesian civil service
        creating an educated, foreign-language literate class of
        Indonesians. But in other ways, democracies are more likely to
        create bureaucracies, because they already function based on
        values of equality under government.

    -   Bureaucratization of government also seems to lead to or covary
        with bureaucratization of parties, because these parties need
        significant power and influence to compete (with other parties
        and government actors)

    -   Weber is super cynical of the effect of public masses (demos) on
        bureaucracy. He says they can affect selection of leaders, but
        in the end, the bureaucracy affects them more than they directly
        affect it.

    -   Bureaucracy, eg. modern army, does break the power of nobles,
        but it only passively advances democratization - it acts in the
        interests of the bureaucracy/state, not the public per say.

**Objective and Subjective Bases of Bureautic Perpetuity**

-   Bureaucracy is hard to destroy. Institutions persist. "Bureaucracy
    is the means of transforming social action into rationally organized
    action\...Where administration has been completely bureaucratized,
    the resulting system of domination is practically indestructible"
    (p. 987). Weber sort of states the condition that Mahoney and Thelen
    try to explain - why do institutions change at all, if they are so
    indestructible?

-   **Objective bases:** anybody who knows how to gain control over
    bureaucracy can take over and use it for their own purposes. Eg.
    **Voldemort takes over Ministry of Magic (yes, it's actually a great
    example**), Hitler over German state, etc. Ergo, institutions
    persist across regimes. Eg. extractive regimes in post-colonial oil
    states.

-   **Subjective Bases (??):** lower officials can't really alter the
    actions of officials at the top of the food chain.

**Economic consequences of Bureaucratization**:

-   Party donors stand behind bureaucratic party orgs and oppose change.
    Think DNC, and why party donors and elites were so uncomfortable
    with eliminating superdelegates, lest centrists cede more control to
    a growing left-wing Democrat movement.

-   Eg. breweries in England, Germany & heavy industry, Democratic Party
    of Japan (DPJ) and Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) and the
    proposed-and-failed shift from nuclear power in 2011

-   Bureaucratization also destroys feudalism and empowers bourgeois
    middle class businesses, because they have standard, reliable laws
    and not willy-nilly feudal lords' preferences to rely on.

**Power Position of Bureaucracy**

-   Political master vs. trained expert

-   *Indispensability* of bureaucracy. Mutualistic relationship, but
    sometimes the bureaucracy can push back and dwarf effects of
    political master; eg. Japan's LDP-staffed bureaucracy refuses to
    implement DPJ mandates while DPJ in power in 2009-2012; public later
    votes DPJ out for ineffective governance.

-   *Ruler's dependence on bureaucracy* - Russian Tsar pre-1905 couldn't
    put anything into effect permanently that displeased his
    bureaucracy. His ministries would bombard each other with memoranda
    and personal intrigue until monarch acquiesed.

-   *Administrative Secrecy:* Bureaucracies often like to keep the
    public out of their affairs (since they often can make life
    difficult for bureaucrats). This means that bureaucrats tend tend to
    use a different policy toolkit that discourages public involvement
    in state policy.

**Collegiate Bodies and Interest Groups**

-   In bureaucratic regimes, leaders surround themselves with
    *collegiate bodies* (eg. Cabinet) to make bureaucratic priorities
    and wants known, have them compete against each other, keeping each
    in check using the others.
