Q. **Does democracy explain variation state infrastructural power?** Can
postcolonial states only gain infrastructural power when their rulers
enjoy unencumbered despotic power?

-   *Alternative arguments*: role of democratic parliaments in
    strengthening or weakening state

-   *Their argument:* competitive elections amid robust mass
    mobilization affect capacity

    -   Multiple causal mechanisms in Southeast Asia

**\*Note: this author uses infrastructural power, institutions, and
capacity sometimes interchangeably. They mean capacity.**

A. Three causal mechanisms allow the strength of democracy in a country
to affect state capacity:

1.  catalyzing the construction of mass ruling parties

2.  energizing state registration of marginal populations

3.  fostering centralized intervention in local authoritarian enclaves.

**Problem:** Relationship between quality of democracy and state
capacity unclear.

-   Democratic Iraq post-Saddam Hussein: "state-breaking," not "state
    making"

-   Democratic postcolonial governments often have weak state capacity

-   Postcolonial states with strong state capacity are often despotic

-   Age of democratization, but not democratic Leviathans

**Literature: Difficult to apply to Southeast Asia**

-   Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia - weak capacity, strong democracy
    (THAILAND????)

-   Singapore and Malaysia have both strong capacity and weak democracy

-   Regional divide in our understanding of role of legislatures on
    capacity.

    -   European cases tell us that legislators defend state from
        predatory behavior and capacity, and public pushes them to do
        so.

        -   "States will be hobbled in their efforts to collect taxes
            unless they can make credible commitments to use the
            revenues in ways that accord with taxpayers' interests"
            (256)

        -   Eg. Margaret Levi (1988), Douglass North and Barry Weingast
            (1989), and Philip Hoffman and Kathryn Norberg (1994)

        -   **Causal mechanism**: Democracy → Legislators →Threatens
            loss of Revenue → State adheres to institutions → Strong
            capacity

    -   East Asian & Southeast Asian cases tell us that legislators
        often *are* predators who benefit from state

        -   Eg. Paul Hutchcroft (2000), John Sidel (1999), and Benedict
            Anderson (1998 \[1988\]).

        -   Causal mechanisms: Electoral democracy -\> Local bosses
            \--\> Weakened bureaucracy \--\> Weak state capacity

    -   Problems with these perspectives:

        -   Explains bureaucratization, not state capacity

        -   Conflicting but plausible hypotheses; questions unresolved

**Hypothesized Causal Mechanisms**

-   *How might competitive elections result in state capacity?*

-   ***Four key factors:***

    -   ***Political parties***

    -   ***Citizen registration***

    -   ***Representation***

    -   ***Electoral administration***

-   ***Competitive elections → new mass public political parties →
    demands public goods → requires citizen registration → requires
    motivation from public → people get registered so they can get
    representation → builds electoral administration → produces state
    capacity***

-   *Not all steps in this process are necessary in all cases*

Case Studies:

-   Why do Thailand and Philippines have weaker capacity than their
    Southeast Asian neighbors, eg. Malaysia

<!-- -->

-   **Malaysia:** Electoral mobilization and social mobilization
    together produced strong mass parties that make states willing and
    able to provide public goods.

    -   *1940s Electoral Mobilization*: UMNO and MCA rose as political
        parties for the public, competing.

    -   *1960s-70s Social Mobilization*: MCA mobilized its members at
        grassroots level to improve outreach and boost public goods, in
        the face of leftist Chinese opposition parties.

-   **Thailand and Philippines:** absence of social mobilization
    resulted in party-state weakness. Electoral mobilization alone is
    insufficient explanation.

-   **Indonesia:** Electoral administration building produced state
    capacity, more so than provision of public goods. In fact, electoral
    administration expanded capacity, making provision of public goods
    easier.

<!-- -->

-   1971 New Order elections: Suharto faced legitimacy crisis; after
    crackdown on communists in 1965-1966, he felt pressure to win the
    election and demonstrate stability, less electoral violence break
    out.

-   Suharto regime aggressively registered voters (more so than it had
    taxpayers), entrusting administrative process only to government
    administration. Created polling spaces at an unprecedented
    neighborhood level, expanding state capacity dramatically. Also,
    used state intelligence agencies to boost support for regime.

<!-- -->

-   **Philippines:** Centralized intervention in local elections to make
    elections more democratic built state capacity.

    -   *Philippines not typically known for relationship between
        democracy and strong state capacity, but the example of
        1951-1953 shows a causal mechanism:*

    -   **1951-1953:** Pres. Magsaysay deployed military and US forces
        to secure polling stations during election and disempower local
        militias intimidating voters on the behalf of local bosses.

**Summary (268-269)**

Competitive elections have facilitated state-building in the region when
they have stimulated:

1.  the formation of stronger mass political parties, or

2.  a more vigorous state commitment to citizen registration, or

3.  the imposition of centralized authority over societal strongmen

Whether elections catalyzed capacity depended on how *competitive* those
elections were, not how *democratic.*

-   We should expect to see relationship between electoral competition
    and state capacity in *competitive authoritarian regimes* as well as
    competitive democratic regimes.

-   Generalizable? Evidence of competitive elections building capacity
    in the US 1877-1917 as well as Western European welfare states

-   "Whether democratic governments in this region \[Eastern Europe\] go
    beyond sealing off the state from predatory interests and actually
    extend the state's infrastructural writ seems to depend not simply
    on robust party competition, but robust mass politics" (269)

-   Possibility of "warlord democratization" (Wantchekon 2004, 31)

-   Caution: Maybe we shouldn't use UN field officers to guarantee fair
    elections, because this limits to ability for regimes to develop
    local capacity. (Super patronizing example, but sort of like the
    argument that lecturing too much limits students' opportunity and
    capacity to discover, develop, and internalize knowledge on their
    own.)
