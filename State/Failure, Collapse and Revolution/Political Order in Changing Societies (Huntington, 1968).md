# Long Summary


[Huntington, "Political Order in Changing Societies" (1968)]{.underline}

\*\*\**This is an insanely long reading. Each chapter is at least 72
pages. So, this is not close to a full summary, but I think I got most
of the main points.*

[Chapter 1]{.underline}

-   Research Question: What is responsible for the rise of violence and
    instability in Asia, Africa, and Latin America after World War II?

-   Main theoretical claim: The rise of violence and instability was due
    to rapid social change and rapid mobilization of new groups coupled
    with the slow development of political institutions. (p. 4)

<!-- -->

-   Social movements and progress undermine traditional political
    structures

-   When institutions are weak and social movements expand, disorder
    results.

    -   "The primary problem of politics is the lag in the development
        of political institutions behind social and economic change."

-   "Institutionalization" = "the process by which organizations and
    procedures acquire value and stability" (12)

<!-- -->

-   Modernity (social mobilization and economic development) yields
    stability and peace

-   BUT, modernization (efforts to achieve modernity) yields instability

    -   Movements to achieve modernity cause disorder, not the lack of
        modernity itself

<!-- -->

-   Not much difference between different forms of government when it
    comes to political stability. Also not much difference between
    modern and traditional governments. What matters is the level of
    institutionalization relative to political participation

-   One new feature of modern states is political parties

-   In post-revolution situations, order is dependent on the existence
    of one strong party

[Chapter 4]{.underline}

-   Questions: 1) What are the causes of military intervention in the
    politics of modernizing countries?

> 2\) What are the consequences of intervention for modernization and
> for political development?

-   The more backward a society, the more progressive the role of the
    military

    -   In progressive societies, military serves as the "guardian" of
        the existing order

<!-- -->

-   In radical societies, militaries can play a developmental,
    modernizing role (student riots, revolutions are usually more bloody
    than military coups)

    -   Effectiveness of military rule associated with its level of
        integration and organizational characteristics

-   Stability comes from alliance between 2 of 3 groups: intelligentsia
    (brains), military (guns), and peasants (votes)

    -   Cooperation of intelligentsia and military very rare

    -   Ability of military to develop stable institutions relies on
        support of peasants

<!-- -->

-   Military tends to dislike politics, resist institution-building
    (here, I understood institutions as primarily political parties)

    -   But organization is impossible without parties, so they
        eventually come into being anyway

    -   Militaries that can establish parties with civilian ties and
        support are the most successful as modernizers/developers -\>
        civilian leaders eventually replace military

<!-- -->

-   To answer the second question he posed at the beginning of chapter,
    military leaders can build institutions and play the role of
    modernizers. They do this most effectively in countries with less
    developed social political life

    -   Potential role for military increases as social complexity
        decreases and level of development decreases

<!-- -->

-   "The truly helpless society is not one threatened by revolution but
    one incapable of it." (262)

[Chapter 5]{.underline}

-   Revolution is distinct from revolt, insurrection, coup, etc.

    -   "rapid , fundamental, and violent domestic change in dominant
        values and myths of a society, ..." (264)

    -   Distinctly modern, Western phenomenon

-   Revolution is an aspect of modernization

    -   Occurs when social and economic development outpaces political
        modernization and development

<!-- -->

-   Measure of how revolutionary a revolution is = rapidity and scope of
    expansion of political participation

-   Measure of how successful a revolution is = authority and stability
    of new institutions

<!-- -->

-   3 parts of full-scale revolution: rapid and violent destruction of
    political institutions, mobilization of new groups in polities,
    creation of new political institutions

<!-- -->

-   Prerequisites for revolution:

1)  Incapability of existing institutions to provide channels for
    participation of new social forces

2)  Desire of social forces to participate in politics

-   Probability of revolution in modernizing a country depends on:

1)  Extent to which urban middle class is alienated from existing order

2)  Extent to which peasants are alienated from existing order

3)  Extent to which urban middle class and peasants join together in
    fighting the same enemy and for the same cause (usually nationalism)

-   Intelligentsia is most active revolutionary group in urban middle
    class

<!-- -->

-   How do peasants become revolutionaries?

1)  Modernization worsens the condition of peasants

2)  Modernization eventually increases the aspirations of peasants

-   Urbanization is a substitute for rural revolution (as urbanization
    increases, risk of revolution decreases)

<!-- -->

-   Every revolution is against the dominant class at home and the
    dominant system abroad
