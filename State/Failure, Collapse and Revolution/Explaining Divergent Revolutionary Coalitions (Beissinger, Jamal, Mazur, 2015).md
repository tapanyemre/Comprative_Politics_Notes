Explaining Divergent Revolutionary Coalitions: Regime Strategies and the
Structuring of Participation in the Tunisian and Egyptian Revolutions
(2015)

Article in a nutshell: Previous studies that have attempted to describe
the causes behind the Arab Spring (youth bulge, social media usage,
educational attainment, modernization, secularization) haven't fully
explained the revolutions that took place. The different uprisings that
occurred throughout the Arab world hardly fit one mold, thus it is
important to compare events between countries. Using data from the Arab
Barometer, the authors examine the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia.
They find that constituencies active in the revolution differed due to
previous actions taken by the state. In Egypt, the revolution was
largely comprised of middle-class persons, who had mobilized in response
to the government's long time divestment from welfare benefits that
helped the middle class. In contrast, the revolution in Tunisia was made
up of a coalition of regional/generational segments in response to
corporatist structure that had restricted civil society and concentrated
social programs in the capital over the periphery.

Main points

-   Demands for improving the economic situation were identified as
    either a primary or secondary reason for revolutionary participation
    by 77 percent of the Tunisian revolutionaries and 67 percent of the
    Egyptian revolutionaries - by far the most frequently cited
    motivation of those cited (followed by combating corruption)

-   While both revolutionary constituencies were majority middle class,
    Tunisian revolutionaries were far more diverse when looking at the
    breakdown (notable segments of students, workers, unemployed, etc)
    while 55% of Egyptian revolutionaries came from traditional middle
    class occupations

-   What explains this different makeup? Response to different
    social-economic conditions by the state, which affected different
    groups disproportionately (see Figure 1 below).

    -   Economic crisis of the 1980s, IFI (international financial
        institutions) led structural adjustment, globalization,
        US/European democracy promotion all lead to pressures of state
        contraction and political reform

    -   Different reactions by Egypt and Tunisia

        -   Egypt: Dismantled welfare protections and shifted burden
            onto the middle class, allowed flourishing of a nascent
            civil society

            -   Civil society enabled the middle class to
                organize/mobilize in response to years of divestment
                from welfare programs, thus the middle class spearheaded
                the revolution

        -   Tunisia: Corporatist, constructivist approach to civil
            society, social investment was concentrated in the capitol,
            which exacerbated regional disparities; minimal organization
            by civil society, revolution made up of cross-coalitions due
            to economic grievances shared by many classes, revolution
            emerged in the periphery

Methodology

-   2011 Arab Barometer, conducted in June 2011 and in Tunisia in
    October 2011 - shortly after the revolutionary tides that swept both
    countries

-   Sample size: In Egypt, 1,220 people were surveyed, while in Tunisia
    the sample size was 1,196

-   Question: \"Did you participate in the protests against former
    president Mubarak (or Ali)". Yes/No response

-   Addition questions asked reasoning behind this (economic, political,
    religious, etc., see Table 1) along with demographic information
    (age, education, income, occupation, etc., see Table 2).
