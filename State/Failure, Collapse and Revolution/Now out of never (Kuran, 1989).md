# Long Summary


Kuran, Timur. 1991. \"Now out of never: The element of surprise in the
East European Revolution of 1989.\"

Abstract: Kuran aims to produce full explanation of social revolution by
incorporating non-linear surge (bandwagon, cascade effect) in
participation of social mobilization based on social psychological
explanation with existing structuralist theory. He notes that
structuralist account explains the condition which triggers revolutions
but mass-revolution always surprises academics to layperson because it
is always unpredictable un terms of timing and place. He explains why
perfectly predicting mass mobilization is difficult because of the
psychological factors: hidden individual preferences, public
preferences, cost of preference falsification, cost of revolting. After
he provides theoretical explanation, he exemplifies a case of 1989
Eastern European Revolutions which consist of successive overthrown of 6
"communist" satellite nations within Soviet federations. Kuran while
admits that structural circumstances such as economic crisis of and
relative decline of economy of Soviet Union triggered mass mobilization,
structural explanation, traditional rational choice or collective action
literature do not give a full picture of non-linear surge, thus
unpredictable pattern in terms of the number and frequency in social
movement. Social psychological/ behaviorist explanation and structural
explanation supplement each other to produce explanation of the rise of
revolution.

Timeframe:

1989 November: Berlin Wall Collapse

1989 December: Rumania Regime Change

1989 December: Czechoslovakia, Collapse of one-party dominance of
communist party (Velvet Revolution)

1990 September: Poland, Cabinet taken by Non-communist party

II\. RECEIVED THEORIES OF REVOLUTION AND THEIR PREDICTIVE WEAKNESSES

1)  Existing theories of social movement put focus on social structures.
    Structures are ostensibly easier to identify, which would seem to
    endow the structuralist theory with predictive superiority over
    \"voluntarist\" theories based on \"rational choice.\"

2)  Puzzle that the standard theory of rational choice cannot solve. The
    standard theory simply fails to make sense of why the first people
    to challenge the regime choose selflessly to gamble with their
    lives. With respect to the East European Revolution in particular,
    the standard theory illuminates why, for all their grievances, the
    nations of the region were remarkably quiescent for so many years.
    It does not explain

III\. PREFERENCE FALSIFICATION AND REVOLUTIONARY BANDWAGONS

1)After all, a mass uprising results from multitudes of individual
choices to participate in a movement

for change; there is no actor named \"the crowd\" or \"the opposition.
The model presented here is in agreement with the rational-choice school
on this basic methodological point, although it departs in important
ways from the standard fare in rational-choice modeling.

2\) Consider a society whose members are indexed by i. Each individual
member must choose whether to support the government in public or oppose
it; depending on his public acts and statements, each person is

perceived as either a friend of the government or an enemy, for the
political status quo or against. In private, of course, a person may
feel torn between the government and the opposition, seeing both
advantages and

disadvantages to the existing regime.

Member of Society: i

Individual\'s private preference: x

Public preference:

Preference Falsification (Dissonance/cost of not expressing private
preferences but showing public preference for obeying):

Size of public opposition: S

Revolutionary threshold: T

3)  External payoff: The larger S, the smaller the individual
    dissenter\'s chances of being persecuted for his identification with
    the opposition and the fewer hostile supporters of the government he
    has to face.

4)  The internal payoff is rooted in the psychological cost of
    preference falsification. The suppression of one\'s wants entails a
    loss of personal autonomy, a sacrifice of personal integrity. It
    thus generates lasting discomfort, the more so the greater the lie.
    This relationship may be captured by postulating that person i\'s
    internal payoff for supporting the opposition varies positively with
    his private preference

5)  So i\'s public preference depends on S and xi. As the public
    opposition grows, with his private preference constant, there comes
    a point where his external cost of joining the opposition falls
    below his internal cost of preference falsification. This switching
    point may be called his revolutionary threshold, T. Since a
    threshold represents a value of S, it is a number between 0 and 100.

6)  Returning to the general model, we can observe that individuals with
    different private preferences and psychological constitutions will
    have different revolutionary thresholds. Imagine a ten-person
    society featuring the threshold sequence A = {0, 20, 20, 30, 40, 50,
    60, 70, 80, 100}.

7)  Person 1 (T1 = 0) supports the opposition regardless of its size,
    just as person 10 (T10 = 100) always supports the government. The
    remaining eight people\'s preferences are sensitive to S: depending
    on its level, they opt for one camp or the other. For instance,
    person 5 (P = 40) supports the government if 0 \< S \< 40 but joins
    the opposition if 40 \' S \' 100. Let us assume that the opposition
    consists initially of a single person, or 10 percent of the
    population, so S = 10. Because the nine other individuals have
    thresholds above 10, this S is self-sustaining; that is, it
    constitutes an equilibrium.

8)  This equilibrium happens to be vulnerable to a minor change in A.
    Suppose that person 2 has an unpleasant encounter at some government
    ministry. Her alienation from the regime rises, pushing her
    threshold down from 20 to 10. The new threshold sequence is A\' =
    {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100}.

9)  Person 2\'s new threshold happens to equal the existing S of 10, so
    she switches sides, and S becomes 20. Her move into the opposition
    takes the form of tossing an egg at the country\'s long-standing
    leader during a government-organized rally. The new S of 20 is not
    self-sustaining but self-augmenting, as it drives person 3 into the
    opposition. The higher S of 30 then triggers a fourth defection,
    raising S to 40, and this process continues until S reaches 90-a new
    equilibrium. Now the first nine individuals are in opposition, with
    only the tenth supporting the government. A slight shift in one
    individual\'s threshold has thus generated revolutionary bandwagon,
    an explosive growth in public opposition.

10) Neither private preferences nor the corresponding thresholds are
    common knowledge. So a society can come to the brink of a revolution
    without anyone knowing this, not even those with the power to
    unleash. That is why revolution and mass-mobilization is
    unpredictable.

11) In sum, revolutionary threshold can change because of one's internal
    preferences, public preference, the trade of between cost of
    psychological falsification and cost of collective action is not
    static. By treating the likelihood of revolution as the sum of the
    individual levels of discontent, the relative-deprivation theory
    overlooks the significance of the distribution of discontent.

12) If one person did not join for mobilization and thus do not hit the
    threshold for other's revolutionary threshold, that situation is
    **latent bandwagon** that never takes off.

13) The theory depicts the individual as both powerless and potentially
    very powerful. The individual is powerless because a revolution
    requires the mobilization of large numbers, but he is also
    potentially very powerful because under the right circumstances he
    may set off a chain reaction that generates the necessary
    mobilization.

IV\. EAST EUROPEAN COMMUNISM AND THE WELLSPRING OF ITS STABILITY

1)  Given the chasm between the rhetoric of communism and its
    achievements, the existence of an opposition is easily understood in
    Eastern Europe. People routinely applauded speakers whose message
    they disliked, joined organizations whose mission they opposed, and
    signed defamatory letters against people they admired, among other
    manifestations of consent and accommodation.

2)  on the cognitive implications of preference falsification.
    Disaffected citizens choosing to conform to the regime\'s demands
    typically paid lip service to official goals

3)  The foregoing argument has two immediate implications. First, the
    regimes of Eastern Europe were substantially more vulnerable than
    the subservience and quiescence of their populations made them seem.
    Millions were prepared to stand up in defiance if ever they sensed
    that this was sufficiently safe. Second, even the support of those
    genuinely sympathetic to the status quo was rather thin.

V. THE REVOLUTION

1)  But what would catalyze the process of revolutionary mobilization?
    With hindsight it appears that the push came from the Soviet Union.
    In the mid-1980s festering economic problems, until then officially
    denied, convinced the top Soviet leadership to call for perestroika
    (restructuring) and glasnost (public openness). Repressed grievances
    burst into the open, including dissatisfaction with communist rule
    itself.

2)  In sum, prior to the actual revolution it was not at all clear that
    the Soviet Union would sit back if its six Warsaw Pact allies tried
    to over-throw their communist regimes. Statements, events, and
    trends that in retrospect appear as unmistakable signs of an
    explosion in the making coexisted with many signs that pointed in
    the direction of inertia and continued stability.

3)  [What specific events set the revolutionary bandwagon in motion? One
    must recognize that attempting to answer this question is akin to
    trying to identify the spark that ignited a forest fire or the cough
    responsible for a flu epidemic. There were many turning points in
    the East European Revolution, any one of which might have derailed
    it.]{.mark}

4)  [It was an extraordinary conjunction of individual decisions that
    kept the uprising peaceful and prevented the revolution from being
    sidetracked. One of the most remarkable aspects of the East European
    Revolution is that, with the partial exception of Romania, the
    security forces and the bureaucracy just melted away in the face of
    growing public opposition.]{.mark}

5)  possibilities. In the days following the fall of Czechoslovakia\'s
    communist regime, a banner in Prague read: \"Poland-10 years,
    Hungary-10 months, East Germany-10 weeks, Czechoslovakia-10
    days.\"83 The implied acceleration reflects the fact that each
    successful challenge to communism lowered the perceived risk of
    dissent in the countries still under communist rule. In terms of our
    model, as revolutionary thresholds in neigh-boring countries fell,
    the revolution became increasingly contagious.

VI\. THE PREDICTABILITY OF UNPREDICTABILITY

1)  [The reason they cannot predict infallibly is not simply that they
    contain large numbers of variables. In each theory variables are
    related to one another nonlinearly; that is, a small perturbation in
    one variable, which normally produces small changes in other
    variables, may under the right set of circumstances have large
    consequences. itself. The notion that small events may unleash huge
    forces goes against much of twentieth century social thought with
    its emphasis on linearity, continuity, and gradualism.]{.mark}

2)  Partly because of preference falsification, the nature of the
    interdependence is imperfectly observable. This is why a massive
    rise in public opposition may catch everyone by surprise. Because
    preference falsification afflicts politics in every society, major
    revolutions are likely to come again and again as a surprise. This
    is not to assert the impossibility of accurate prediction. If we
    possessed a reliable technique for measuring people\'s revolutionary
    thresholds, we would see what it would take to get a revolution
    started. And if we understood the determinants of these thresholds,
    we would know when the required conditions were about to be met. For
    all practical purposes, however, such information is available only
    in highly incomplete form.
