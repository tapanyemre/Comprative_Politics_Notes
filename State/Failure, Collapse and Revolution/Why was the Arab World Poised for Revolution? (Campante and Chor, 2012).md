# Long Summary


Campante and Chor, Why was the Arab World Poised for Revolution?

Claim: education and its connection with the economic environment are
prominent explanatory factors for the Arab spring.

-   This can be viewed within the context of the modernization
    hypothesis

-   Improvements in education access outpaced job increases, which led
    to instability in the Arab world (a la Huntington)

-   The authors argue that increased educational opportunities occurred
    while labor prospects remained poor, especially at the countries at
    the heart of the Arab spring.

    -   Thus, there was an increase at the individual level of political
        protest activity, especially among the educated. These
        conditions are the predictors of instability/incumbent change at
        state level.

    -   Political participation increased along with education levels
        because of the higher value of the income the educated can't
        access. Opportunity cost.

Takeaway: greater gains in education at the national level -\> stronger
individual propensity toward protest activity, especially when combined
with poor labor market conditions.

Conclusion: Prior grievance based explanations of the Arab Spring need
to be complemented with the opportunity cost model the authors
emphasize. It's less costly to act on grievances when your country's
labor conditions are weak.
