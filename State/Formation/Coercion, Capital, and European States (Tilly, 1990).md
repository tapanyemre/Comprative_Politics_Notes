# Long Summary


**Tilly Coercion Ch 3: How War Made States and Vice Versa**

-   Eurocentric perspective. He talks about a bifurcation of violence (a
    la Cross)-violence has declined outside the state's realm. Wars
    between great powers are fewer and more deadly.

-   States have increased tendency to monitor/control/monopolize means
    of violence

[How States Controlled Coercion]{.underline}

-   Built up coercive means without letting civilian populations access
    them

-   Non state violent groups still exist but the balance of violence has
    shifted to favor the state

-   Creation of armed forces created durable state structure. The forces
    were significant organizations within the state and brought with
    them complementary orgs

-   Mobilizations for war became how states
    expanded/consolidated/created new political orgs. Prep for war
    creates internal structures of states.

[Wars]{.underline}

-   They occur because coercion works to gain compliance

-   Euro states would have:

    -   Their territory where they enjoyed the returns from coercion

    -   A buffer zone that they'd eventually incorporate, which would
        continually expand borders. This would lead to war with
        neighbors

-   War as the dominant activity of Euro states in the last millennia

    -   War made budgets and debts common, taxes rose

    -   Caused an increase in bureaucratization

    -   Formalized police forces to control the civilians while freeing
        up the military for warfare

    -   Capitalism expansion grew militaries, making smaller states
        vulnerable as armies became big business. Use of mercenaries
        during this period

    -   When war shifted from being fought by mercenaries to by
        civilians, the state had to extract more and thus became more
        answerable to popular demands. This altered the relationship
        between warmaking and civilians

[Seizing, Making, Buying Coercion (how coercion/force was
consolidated)]{.underline}

-   As weaponry developed, less civilians possessed the means of war.
    For instance, no family owned an aircraft carrier.

-   Rulers completed the process by largely disarming civilian
    populations. This delineated the controllers of the means of war
    from the populations expected to pay for the war

-   States increased production of means of war and conscription became
    largely unpopular

Debt and capitalism (loans) are important here. I think the main point
is that the nation state rose out of a hybrid capitalized/coercion
approach to warfare. The state apparatus emerged from interaction
between the military machine and the development of markets.
