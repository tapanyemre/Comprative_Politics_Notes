# Long Summary

#### First Summary


**"War Making and State Making as Organized Crime"**

**(***full disclosure, some of the pages were cut off at the bottom,
usually just a couple lines)*

-   **War making and state making are "quintessential protection rackets
    with the advantage of legitimacy" → largest example of organized
    crime**

-   **State are essentially greatly organized crime syndicates**

-   The author has growing concerns about:

    -   Increasing destructiveness of war

    -   Expanding role of great power as suppliers of arms and military
        organization to poor countries

    -   The growing importance of military rule in those same countries
        (169)

<!-- -->

-   Looking at the European experience might help understanding what is
    happening to day in Third World Countries (TWC)

-   TWCs in the 20th century do not resemble European countries of the
    16th and 17th century, however the author argues that his analysis
    will show that coercive exploitation played a large part in the
    creation of the European states

-   This essay will discuss "the place of organized means of violence in
    the growth and change of those peculiar forms of government we call
    nation-states" (170)

*The author makes several claims:*

1)  there is an interdependence between war making and state making

2)  At a smaller and less successful scale this interdependence can also
    be called organized crime

3)  War makes states.

4)  "Banditry, piracy, gangland rivalry, policing and war making all
    belong on the same continuum" (170)

5)  Mercantile capitalism and state making reinforce each other.

**Double-edged protection**

-   Apologists for governments will argue that they offer protection
    from local and external violence

-   They will also claim that the prices they charge barely cover the
    cost of protection (171)

-   People who oppose this notion will be called "anarchists" (for
    instance)

-   The author, however, argues that governments are essentially
    racketeers, as they cause the threat and then demand money for
    protection.

-   The government's monopoly of violence makes its claim of providing
    protection "credible and difficult to resist" (172)

-   The author, however, continues his claims, by suggesting that in the
    early stages of European state making the intention was never to
    create a state.

-   War making, extraction and capital accumulation were integral parts
    of the European state making process, yet those in power never
    intended to create a state but just to solidify their power and to
    eradicate the competition → cycle continued and perpetuated the
    state formation

**Violence and Government**

-   What is the difference between state violence and other forms of
    violence

-   State more effective, larger scale, etc. than other organizations,
    which gave it its legitimate notion slowly over time

-   State initially used outside sources to consolidate their power and
    to demilitarize competing forces (i.e. Tudors, Richelieu in France)

-   Eventually European governments reduced reliance on local magnets

    -   By extending officialdom in local communities

    -   By encouraging creation of police forces, which were subordinate
        to the government and not individual landlords (therefore not
        small armies, but more removed from war making process,
        therefore being less threatening)

-   → massive pacification and monopolization of the means of coercion

**Protection as Business**

-   Governments are in the business of selling protection, whether the
    people want it or not

-   Activity of producing and controlling violence favors monopolies,
    competition raises the costs (instead of lowering them) → production
    of violence enjoys large economies of scale

-   Tilly discusses a couple of economic ideas/models that illustrate
    the coincidence of war making/state making with the history of
    capitalism (four steps, page 176/177)

-   Frederic Lane (economic historian) distinguished between the
    **monopoly profit** (coming to owners of the means of producing
    violence as a result of the difference between production costs and
    the price exacted from the customers) and the **protection rent
    (**from customers, who got effective protection against outside
    competitors)

-   Depending on who actually owns the government, different behavior
    would be expected by the managers of the protection-providers

    -   Citizens in general ("Jeffersonian democracy"): minimize
        protection cost and monopoly profit → maximize protection rent

    -   Monarch ("Petty despotism"): maximize profit, indifferent to
        protection rent

    -   Managers themselves ("Military Junta"): keep costs high by
        maximizing their wages, maximize profit, exacting high prices
        from subjects, indifferent to protection rent

-   A critique of Lane is, so Tilly, that he fails to acknowledge that
    customers might not be willing participants in this exchange of
    services

-   Richard Bean (economic historian) adds to that that the change of
    technology and the improvement of artillery prompted the creation of
    large, well armed national states

**History Talks**

-   While historically not too sound, Bean's logic supports the model of
    Lane in so far as different types and styles of military to cost
    different amounts and bring with it different side costs, concerns,
    and opportunities to conquer territory

-   Territory should be more understood in this context (at least until
    the 18th century) was the sea

-   Yet, both Lane and Beam in their analysis, fail to recognize the
    relationship between capital accumulation and military expansion

    -   The importance of national debt in times of war making (france,
        England)

    -   The importance of increased taxation during war times, which
        rarely goes down to prior thresholds, rather stays elevated in
        peace times)

**What do States do?**

-   Lane's analysis fails to distinguish between different types of
    state-controlled violence

-   Agents of state generally do the following four

    -   War making (eliminating rivals outside)

    -   State making (eliminating rivals inside)

    -   Protection (eliminating rivals of clients)

    -   Extraction (acquiring means to carry out the first three)

-   Can take on different forms, all depend on state's tendency to
    monopolize the concentrated means of coercion

-   Each of them generally reinforces the other

-   Each produced characteristic forms of organization

-   The more costly the activity, the larger the organizational residue

-   The four are interdependent, but occur in various forms in different
    European countries

**How States Formed**

-   This analysis (if correct, so the author) has two strong
    implications for the development of the nation-state

    -   Popular resistance to war making and state making made a
        difference

        -   Resistance brought about concessions in forms of rights,
            representative institutions, courts of appeal

        -   Which in turn constrain further war and state making

    -   The relative balance between the four affected the organization
        of the states

-   This simplified model neglects the external relations that have
    impacted every nation state

-   Three interlocking influences connected every state to the European
    network of states

    -   Flow of resources in form of loans/supplies

    -   Competition among states for hegemony in disputed territories →
        stimulated war making, blurred lines between WM, SM, extraction

    -   Intermittent creation of coalitions of states to force another
        state into a certain form or position in the international
        system (war making coaltions/peace making coalitions → huge
        impact on number of states in the system)

**War as International Relations**

-   War became the normal conditions in the international system of
    states to enhance/defend position

-   Why war?

    -   No one answer will do apparently

    -   But follows the mechanism of state making:

        -   Extension and defense of a perimeter within which the means
            of violence were monopolized, increasing the return of
            profit, continues on a large scale to the logic of war

        -   Early on external/internal rivals overlap → over time
            extension of territory sharpens that distinction

    -   This type of logic of state making follows apparently on a
        larger scale the logic of local aggrandizement

-   Looking at the importance of the external and internal, Tilly sets
    up a schema of the history of European state-making

    -   1\. Differential success of some power holders in "external"
        struggles establishing the difference between an "internal" and
        "external" arena for the deployment of force

    -   2\. "External" competition generates "internal" state making

    -   3\. "External" compacts among states influence the form and
        locus of particular states ever more powerfully

<!-- -->

-   This model does not really apply to the other areas in the world

-   Europe distinguishes itself in state-making through the built-up of
    its military apparatuses through sustained struggles with their
    subject population and by selective extension of protection to
    different classes within those populations (185/186)

-   Newer states have acquired their military from outside, without
    forging of mutual constraints between rulers and ruled

-   Outside states continue to supply these militaries → creating
    powerful organizations, which are not constrained by a struggle

-   Managers of those militaries wield large quantities of power →
    creating large incentive to seize power over to the whole state

-   This great disproportion in contemporary states outside of Europe
    between the military organization and other state organization is
    what highlights the "organized crime" - nature of war
    making/state-making

#### Second Summary

**Tilly: War Making and State Making as Organized Crime**

-   He compares state/war making to protection rackets

-   Looking specifically at the European experience-Euro states were
    formed through coercive exploitation-his claim is that war makes
    states

-   State protection is double edged-the state produces both the danger
    and the shield against it (racketeering)

-   We need to consider the centrality of force to all other forms of
    government growth and change

-   War making and other forms of state violence are on the same
    continuum as racketeering

-   Use of force is the domain of the state, so legitimacy is the
    conformity of other actors within the state to that use of force by
    the state

[Making of Euro States]{.underline}-controllers of these states weren't
looking to make nations, but to be powerful. Processes: war making,
extraction of resources from populations for that war making, capital
accumulation

[Violence and Government]{.underline}-state personnel were more
successful at purveying violence than non-state personnel. The lines of
state/non-state violence were blurry for a long time.

-   The distinction between legit and illegit violence came about
    slowly. State builders had to use a lot of strategies to consolidate
    their monopoly on power including the use of non-military police
    forces that answered to the government

[Protection as Business]{.underline}-mercantile capitalism and state
making reinforce each other

-   Extracting more in taxes than is necessary for protection

-   Military innovation and capitalism helped make nation-states

-   War making in early Euro states was the large cause of the rise of
    debt and taxes

[States have 4 interdependent functions]{.underline} that rely on the
state's coercive monopoly and provide structure to states by determining
the kind of government they'll have:

1.  War making-eliminating/neutralizing their rivals outside of the
    territory over which they command force

2.  State making-eliminating/neutralizing rivals inside their territory

3.  Protection-eliminating/neutralizing enemies of their clients (the
    usage of clients is weird, I think it's like constituency or loyal
    base)

4.  Extraction-acquiring the means of carrying out the above

[How States Formed]{.underline}

-   Resistance to war/state making led to concessions made-the
    guarantees of citizen rights etc. These things also constrained
    further paths to war/state making

-   The relative balance of the 4 aforementioned components affected the
    organization of states (and how those states would consolidate their
    power) that came out of them.

    -   For instance: an emphasis on war making led to a state that
        emphasized military force; an emphasis on state making led to a
        state that emphasized policing and surveillance.

[War as IR]{.underline}

-   External successes divided the internal from the external

-   External competition generates internal state making

-   External agreements among states influence form/locus of states
