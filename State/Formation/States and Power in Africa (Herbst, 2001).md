# Long Summary



**States and Power in Africa**

**The European Experience of State Consolidation (***the reading starts
in the middle of chapter one, with this sub-headline)*

-   This chapter is an introductory chapter

-   Main question is how those who wanted to create African states
    responded to the main issue of political geography, which is an
    issue when wanting to maintain the monopoly of violence in a said
    territory (ala Weber)

-   Brief introduction to state consolidation in europe, then africa

-   State formation is largely only looked at in the European context
    (best documented, and most nation-states today are a copy of the
    European model)

-   The european model is, however, not a good template for state-making
    in other regions of the world

-   State consolidation in Africa should also not just be an analysis of
    colonial and post-colonial rule

-   Rather, an understanding of a continuum and an understanding of what
    happened in pre-colonial times, and what was and wasn't changed
    through the imposition of colonial rule

-   The author suggests that in order to understand state consolidation
    in Africa one needs to examine three basic dynamics:

    -   1\) the assessment of the costs of expansion by an individual
        leader

    -   2\) the nature of buffer mechanisms established by the state

    -   3\) the nature of the regional state system

-   (the author notes that he kind of disregards the boundaries of
    comparative and IR to provide a more "holistic analysis")

*Brief overview Europe:*

-   15th century, population density increases, competition for
    territory begins

    -   → increased pressure to strengthen states in order to fight wars

-   To quote Charles Tilly: main reason for centralizing the state
    apparatus was the "continuous competiton for trade and territory
    among states of unequal size, which made war a driving force in
    European history" (13)

-   War central to state formation: raise taxes, enlist men as soldiers,
    develop infrastructure → to win battles

-   The fear of losing territory motivated leaders not to just focus on
    the capital but also ensure that "hinterland" is protected, so that
    remote areas are not lost

    -   Close links between cities and surrounding territories

    -   Growth of states closely correlated with significant urban areas

    -   Commercial and demographic impact of cities

-   Defending border protected the state from external threats and
    consolidated internally

*Brief overview Africa:*

-   The European experience not a common thing around the world

-   Africa reached in 1975 the population density, Europe enjoyed in the
    1500s

-   Low population rates show a different history of the relationship
    between capitals (bigger cities) and the "hinterland" areas

-   In Africa, many of the states were created before well before the
    capitals had reached "maturity"

-   Europeans created during colonizing times urban areas

    -   Their purpose, however, different

        -   Not to create bonds between city and hinterland

        -   But to serve the needs of the colonizers (i.e. many built
            near coasts)

-   Where states had settler colonies, that's where some sort of
    political life (by white people) was created; that's where
    transitions of power during the fall of colonies was the most brutal
    b/c people actually had some sort of interest/stake in the land

-   In post-colonial times, with the emergence of nationalist politics,
    politics were still an urban matter due to lack of infrastructure
    and reach

    -   A favoring of urban areas emerged, i.e. taxing rural areas
        heavily to appease the urban population

    -   It has also caused a struggle between the governments' abilities
        to enforce policies in rural areas, as those attempt to retain
        more authority

    -   Additionally, a long economic crisis (since the 1970s) has
        hindered the government due to lack of bases to exert or
        "project" power

    -   This pertains as well as to the state's inability to exert
        physical control over their territory (decaying armies)

    -   Waves of democratization in the 1990s or uprisings against
        authoritarian regimes are largely started in urban areas, not in
        rural peasant territory

<!-- -->

-   When comparing Africa and Europe in precolonial, colonial and
    independent times is their main difference in what is usually the
    most dramatic action a state can do: wage war

*The three dynamics:*

1)  **Costs (only brief introduction, further discussed in a different
    chapter):**

-   African leaders face different costs and calculations than European
    leaders

-   They face a variety of costs when trying to extend their power

    -   Short-term, som associated with conquest

    -   Some tied to the types of changes being brought about in the
        extension (telecommunication, infrastructure, etc.)

    -   Long-term (can be post-poned at times) that are largely tied to
        consolidation measures

-   In Africa, due to different types of wars (usually for people and
    treasures, not land like in Europe) conquest and consolidation two
    types of costs

    -   In Europe, after a war, usually an infrastructure and
        organization was left behind

**2) Boundaries (only brief introduction, further discussed in a
different chapter):**

-   Boundary politics: defined as attempts by states to mediate
    pressures from the international system through the use of buffer
    mechanisms to maximize their authority over territory → useful to
    examine extension of authority (24)

-   States lower costs of controlling territory by developing boundary
    institutions to insulate the state from potential economic and
    political threats (24)

-   Most consequential buffer mechanism is the actual physical border a
    state has to mediate pressure from rivals

    -   A weakness of African states, as they have remained unchanged
        since they were hurriedly imposed, without considering
        political, sociological, economic or ethnic factors (25)

-   However, this book argues in a later chapter, that it is those
    physical boundaries that are actually a foundation on which leaders
    can create further institutions, and they are essential to
    illustrate patterns in state consolidation in Africa

-   Interestingly enough, the author argues against common wisdom (in a
    future chapter) and stresses that international institutions or the
    international system has less of an influence on domestic decisions
    by African leaders than has been previously assumed

**3) State Systems:**

-   African states have created their own state system to confront
    difficulties they were having in order to rule their territories

-   It is more marked by cooperation rather than conflict, which is a
    challenge to realism and its assumptions about anarchical structures
    in the international system

-   One needs to understand and remember that the state system is not a
    given and can be manipulated to lower costs

<!-- -->

-   An understanding of the three dynamics and how they work together
    and impact each other in cost calculations is fundamental for
    analyzing and understanding (so the author)

-   "The viability of the African states depends on leaders successfully
    meeting the challenges posed by their particular environments" (31)
