# Long Summary

[Chapter 1]{.underline}

-   Tilly's assessment of war-making and state-making is incomplete. It
    is not as instructive for instances outside Europe

-   Uses 17th century Ottoman Empire (transitional period) as example

-   Main argument: states develop and consolidate by "entering into
    conflict, negotiation, and accommodation within the existing
    configuration of forces in society" (17)

    -   This is similar to Tilly, but the different configuration of
        forces in society create differences in state-making,
        consolidation, and centralization

-   In Ottoman case, banditry and negotiation were more important than
    the coercion and capital methods of Europe.

-   Ottoman Empire did not face serious challenges by societal forces

    -   Unlike in Europe, there was no collective action of peasants,
        and there was no alliance between elites and peasants to
        threaten the states (see next point)

-   Elites competed among themselves

-   Peasants were held back by banditry, which was tolerated and
    somewhat encouraged by state

    -   Basically, in regions of economic distress, young landless men
        became vagrants, were offered jobs as soldiers, and were
        disbanded when no longer needed by Empire. With no jobs again
        (but this time with guns and training) they returned to their
        region and acted as mercenaries and/or bandits. They were then
        easily employed by tax collectors, state officials, etc. whose
        direct or indirect aims were to repress peasantry (full details
        on top of page 12).

    -   The state would then be seen as protecting the people when it
        forced these local employers of bandits to stop terrorizing the
        peasantry. At times, it armed peasants to defend themselves,
        thus creating more bandits in the future and opportunity for
        perpetual cycle of centralization and legitimation.

-   So, three distinct features of Ottoman state consolidation in 17th
    century: 1) lack of class-based collective action of peasantry; 2)
    development of bandit pool; 3) state-bandit bargaining

    -   Explained through "interaction between the state and the
        peculiar organization of societal groups (21)

[Chapter 2]{.underline}

This chapter mostly just establishes context for the argument described
above and returned to in Chapter 3. Describes Ottoman society and
state-society relations, as well as puts the empire in context of 16th
and 17th century world.

-   Core of empire had uniform arrangements for fiscal policy, periphery
    had a degree of autonomy

    -   State control exerted from periphery to center, not
        horizontally - elites and peasants segmented

        -   No collective action or feeling of identity among social
            group

-   Royal authority seen as central to ensuring justice for a prosperous
    populace

    -   State was supreme, but needed to attend to needs of populace

-   Rival central and provincial armies and bureaucracies propped up the
    state by pitting groups in competition for state rewards

-   Provincial officials were rotated to prevent the rise of one house

    -   Land belonged to the state

-   Hierarchical judge class enforced traditional and religious law as
    it was customarily applied, no development of rational law as in
    Europe

    -   Sufi orders and other social groups were neutralized by judges,
        co-optation of leadership, and/or through the Sunni religious
        establishment

    -   Judges also served as intermediary between peasant and landowner
        in the interest of stability

-   Absence of civil society

-   17th century crisis:

    -   Population doubled during 16th century

    -   Monetary fluctuation from influx of silver from New World and
        changing international trade routes to the detriment of Ottomans

    -   Price hikes, with price of wheat increasing 20 times in 17th
        century

    -   Poor economic policies to manage the above

-   Despite the crisis, the state adapted, did not enter decline

    -   Elites became divided, more dependent on state, peasants
        similarly divided, establishment of banditry described in Ch. 1

[Chapter 3]{.underline}

-   Literature on European state-making focuses on elite discontent and
    state-elite relations

    -   Ottoman elites were unable to oppose the state and not
        interested in breaking the cycle of rule

-   Why? 1) elites were trained by the state, tied their fortunes to
    thes tate, and had no autonomy because of state manipulation; 2) The
    state created a provincial system in which organized opposition was
    impossible

-   Main argument: This system created winners and losers, and
    competition among and within each group of elites (landholders,
    governors, etc.)

-   17th century represented turning point for empire (neither at its
    peak or in decline)

-   Methodology:

    -   two sections of society - lower-level and higher-level elites

    -   Narratives, historical analyses, and data on provincial
        assignments

    -   From 1572-1582, little change

    -   From 1654-1655 (after reform of provincial system), much more
        variation

-   Timor (land) holders

    -   competition for larger well-established, wealthy timors

    -   2-3 year rotations, traditionally to members of military as
        reward

    -   In 1650s, tenures extended as timor holders began to pay state a
        yearly fee to hold timor and avoid fighting requirement

    -   More timors granted to those that posed the greatest threat to
        the state (vagrants, higher-level timors that could become
        displeased)

-   **This system benefited the state by either guaranteeing
    participation in war or by receiving payment for use of provincial
    land owned by the state**

    -   Meanwhile, competition among timor-holders to find and keep good
        land without going to war

-   Higher-level elites had similar competition for better assignments

    -   Also, no cohesion among different elite groups because there
        were winning and losing groups

    -   In 16th century, most official appointments based on
        experience - had to rise through ranks

    -   17th century shift to "merit" system similar to timors -
        unpredictable, businesslike system
