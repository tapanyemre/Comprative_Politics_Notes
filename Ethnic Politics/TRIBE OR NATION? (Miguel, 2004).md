TRIBE OR NATION?: Nation Building and Public Goods in Kenya versus
Tanzania (2004)

Edward Miguel, Professor of Economics at Berkeley

Ph.D in Economics at Harvard (what a shocker)

**Article in a nutshell** (direct from the article): This article
examines how central government nation-building policies affect
interethnic cooperation, by comparing the relationship between local
ethnic diversity and public goods across two nearby rural districts, one
in western Kenya and one in western Tanzania, using colonial-era
national boundary placement as a \"natural experiment.\" The empirical
evidence in this article suggests that the Tanzanian nation-building
approach has allowed ethnically diverse communities in rural Tanzania to
achieve considerable success in fund-raising for local public goods,
while diverse communities in the nearby Kenyan region typically fail.

A NATION-BUILDING CASE STUDY: KENYA VERSUS TANZANIA GEOGRAPHIC AND
HISTORICAL COMMONALITIES

-   Kenya and Tanzania are a natural paired comparison, with similar
    geography and histories, but they have followed radically different
    nation building policies since independence.

POST INDEPENDENCE DIVERGENCES

-   Despite these geographical, historical, and institutional
    commonalities in western Kenya and western Tanzania, postcolonial
    central governments in the two countries have pursued radically
    different public policies toward ethnicity, and we argue that this
    divergence has had an impact on current ethnic relations.

    -   National language policy: Kiswahili (Swahili) as the national
        language over English in Tanzania. In contrast, although Swahili
        has long been widely spoken in Kenya as a lingua franca, it
        competes with English and local \"vernacular\" languages such as
        Kikuyu in official settings, including political forums and
        schools.

    -   The public school curriculum in Tanzania has been aggressively
        employed as a nation-building tool. Nearly twenty years after
        independence, Court and Kinyanjui concluded that \"Tanzanian
        students have a stronger sense of national identity than their
        Kenyan counterparts. \" Unlike in Tanzania, the central
        government in Kenya has not used the school curriculum to
        promote a coherent national linguistic or ideological identity:
        the official geography, history, and civics (GHC) curriculum
        does not study Kenya as a nation until grade 5. The focus on
        provincial geography and history in grades 1-4 probably serves
        to exacerbate regional and ethnic divisions, especially among
        the many Kenyans who drop out of primary school before grade 5.

    -   Part of these policy divergences can be attributed to the
        personalities and philosophies ofthe respective independence
        leaders, Jomo Kenyatta and Julius Nyerere. Inspired by a
        Pan-Africanist and socialist political philosophy, the gifted
        Tanzanian leader Nyerere forcefully downplayed the role of
        ethnic affiliation in public life and instead emphasized a
        single Tanzanian national identity.

    -   Another important component of the reform package carried out in
        Tanzania was the complete overhaul of local government
        institutions, with the aim of strengthening village councils and
        district councils. In Kenya, by contrast, the colonial-era
        system of centrally appointed tribal chiefs has been retained.

    -   Finally, the regional distribution of central government
        resources for education, health, and infrastructure-has
        politicized ethnicity to a far greater extent in Kenya. While
        the equitable regional distribution of public investment in
        education, health, and infrastructure has been a centerpiece of
        Tanzanian socialist policies since the 1960s,46 the post
        independence regime in Kenya heavily favored the ethnically
        Kikuyu areas that formed the core of Kenyatta\'s political
        support, and the same has been true of political appointments.

Here's some econometrics for ya: Y= a+ X\'0 k+ k ELF. +u
