# Long Summary

**Ethnic Groups in Conflict** by Horowitz

#### **Chapter 1: The Dimensions of Ethnic Conflict**

-   Ethnic conflict is a world phenomenon

-   Even in countries where there is no open ethnic conflict there are
    examples where parties, unions and even armed forces are
    factionalized along ethnic lines.

Ethnic conflict depends on international environment:

-   The 18^th^-century of national states gave birth for countries like
    Germany and Italy out of more parochial units.

-   The 20^th^-centurey entailed dismemberment of empires in favor of
    smaller units starting form WWI. Then decolonization after WWII.

-   After gaining independence in a post-colonial country an internal
    ethnic conflict was activated.

Word-wide Ideological and institutional underpinnings of ethnic
conflict:

-   Norms of equality made ethnic subordination illegitimate

-   Value of achievement (*Sasha:* *don't really understand this one p.
    5)*

-   European model of ethnic conflict: Control of the state, control of
    *a* state, exemption from control by others (p.5)

All this make ethnic conflict universal and ubiquitous. Groups can learn
from each other. This uniformity allows good comparative analysis.

**The long Reach of Ethnic affiliation**

-   New states especially susceptible to ethnic divisions (Asia, Africa
    Middle East, Caribbean).

-   Behavior based on ethnicity is normatively sanctioned and hostile
    toward outgroup.

-   Although ethnic affiliations can be compartmentalized, they have a
    tendency of seepage to other sectors -- premeative propensity of
    ethnic affiliations (p.7)

-   Ethnic affiliations structure political and economic activity (p.7)

-   Ethnic political parties usually have irreconcilable aims.

-   Sometimes avowedly non-ethnic parties can be captured by ethnic
    constituency.

-   Class revolts and insurgency sometimes derived from ethnic
    aspirations (p.10)

-   In societies where ethnicity suffuses organizational life, all
    political events have ethic consequences (dah!) (p.12)

**The Case for comparative analysis (***Sasha:* *this is just different
issue in the* field**)**

-   After WWII there was a thought that industrialized countries
    outgrown ethnic political affiliation

-   When the force of ethnic affiliation was acknowledged it was often
    treated as a consequence of something else (traditionalism, stresses
    of modernization, class struggle) p.13

-   Ethnic conflict often was treated as epiphenomenon because of the
    scholars' bias.

-   For long time ethic relationships were perceived only as
    relationships between superior and subordinate (like in US).

-   Alternative dogma is groups compete for resources. But it is not
    clear why it should be along ethnic line and not class or other
    lines.

-   Some argue that language and religion play important role

-   There is a debate wither or not racial conflicts (based on some
    distinct difference in appearance) are any different from other
    ethnic conflict

> Because of all this issues author argue that we need better
> understanding of the scope of
>
> inquiry. The class of cases need carful delimitation (p.16).

**The scope of comparison**

1.  States that he analyzes in this book are severely divided (Asia,
    Africa and Caribbean)

-   Most of them received independence during or after WWII

2.  Ethnic groups are not in hierarchical relationships. They divided by
    vertical cleavage for example Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba in Nigeria
    (p.17)

3.  The groups are large, and they interact in the center of political
    process.

4.  The groups are defined by ascriptive differences (color, language,
    religion or something else)

[The class of states]{.underline}

The state that he analyzes are similar in following:

-   Common experience of colonialism and post colonialism

-   No resilience to conflict

-   Military rule is frequent in those countries

The difference between ethnic conflict in studied countries compared to
Western ethnic conflicts:

1.  Supraethnic identities (*national identity*) are more salient in the
    west and sometimes absent in Asia and Africa

2.  There are alternative identities at the same level. So, ethnicity
    compete with all other identities. While in Asia, Africa and
    Caribbean ethnicity tend to displace all other identities (p.19).

3.  In the west the intensity of ethnic tensions is lower.

[Structure of group relations]{.underline}

-   Distinction between ranked and unranked groups. Ranked -- when
    ethnic division coincide with social class.

If ethnic groups are in hierarchical order to each other there is only
one direction of the conflict while in parallel ordering of the groups
(see figure 1. below) the conflict may take different courses. (p. 22)

In unranked system each ethnic group internally stratified. In such
system the question of superiority is still relevant, but it is not
settled. Such societies can be called *polydomainal (*different position
of the group in different domains) (p.23).

[Ranked and unranked systems in practice]{.underline}

-   Neither type of system is pure.

-   The distinction is blurred in practice. Because different ethnic
    groups may have different shape of the stratification structure
    (More/less elites, more mobility).

-   Nevertheless, we can distinguish between ranked and unranked:

*Sasha: all of those features were dispersed in the text. I collected
them and put in this table*

-   Ranked systems are the result of conquest or capture

-   Unranked produced by:

1.  Invasion that is short of conquest (Nigeria and Sri Lanka),

2.  Voluntary migration (Malaysia),

3.  Encapsulating in one territory groups that had little to do with
    each other previously (result of colonial rule).

> Those different origins may produce different grievances (p.30)

-   In ranked system, ethnic conflict resembles class conflict which may
    look like social revolutions (p.30).

-   In unranked systems, ethnic conflict resembles conflict of the
    states in international environment (diplomacy, negotiations,
    alliances, treaties, exchange of the hostages). Groups' aims
    resembles sovereign autonomy.

The distinction between ranked and unranked societies resolves the
confusion between ethnic and class conflict (p.32).

[Change in Ranked and unranked systems]{.underline}

All ranked system are in state of rapid transition or of increasing
coercion.

On the global scale ethnic subordination is on the decline.

Here is the mechanism of [change in ranked system]{.underline}:

-   The spread of Western norms, education, and economical change give
    the rise to the new leaders in subordinate group. Superordinate
    group unable to adapt and to accommodate the rising number of
    leaders in subordinate group. Consequently, subordinate leaders aim
    to destroy the principle of subordination that impedes their
    mobility.

-   He also mentions that at some point leaders demand the change or
    reversal of negative labels that assign to subordinate group.

Directions of change for ranked system:

1.  Displacing superordinate group (Rwanda and Zanzibar)

2.  Abolition of ethnic division (post war Liberia, official goal in US)

3.  Attempt to rise the position without denying of hierarchy (India)

4.  Move the system from ranked to unranked (also India) (p.34)

[Mechanism of change in Unranked system]{.underline}

-   Although there is no clear hierarchy. One group may be
    overrepresented in education, higher class, government or other)

-   Strong pressure for educational and occupational proportionality

-   As a reaction to this pressure the more advantageous groups may
    coerce other group and move the society to the ranked system.

In some societies we may have mixed systems where some groups in
unranked relationships but with other group they are in ranked
relationship. In such cases there is a displacement of aggression on
parallel group instead of aggression to superordinate group (p.36).

Because of different mechanisms in each type of systems we should not
lump them all together

**The locus of group relations**

-   The distinction between societies with a number of small ethnic
    groups (scattered of dispersed) and societies where big enough
    ethnic groups may appeal to center of the political struggle
    (centralized).

-   Ethnic groups will concentrate their effort on the highest level of
    activity that promise success. This means that small ethnic group
    will focus on local political issues while larger groups will be
    involved in a larger political struggle.

[Dispersed societies]{.underline}

-   Simultaneous movement in number of directions (each group pursue its
    own agenda)

-   Pressure is off the center (because ethnic groups are too local).

-   Conflict between locality and the center

-   Center can make concessions to local groups easily because there is
    no general political threat

-   Cooperation between groups is possible

-   Center is often so heterogeneous, so it may be perceived as a
    neutral arbiter.

[Centralized societies]{.underline}

-   Claims of one group tend to be made in expanse of another

-   Leader usually relies on the support of one specific group

-   Less cooperation between groups

-   Fewer cleavages, but those few runs through the whole society

-   Conflict between specific group

-   Center is a focal point of competition

As with ranked and unranked systems in the reality there is no clear-cut
distinction between dispersed and centralized societies. In Nigeria
groups has not more then 20% and still they compete for central
government.

**Indicators of ethnic identity**

Author discuss the distinction between race and ethnicity. The argument
is that race is different based on two assumptions:

1.  Color differences are capable of arousing uniquely intense emotions
    and loyalties /

Author disagrees and argues that it is based on the fact that color
differences were present in ranked system. The harshness of those
systems was attributed to the distinctiveness of the color, but this is
a confusion of indicator for the substance of the relationship (p.42).
In other words, the right distinction is between ranked and unranked
system rather than identity that based on color or not.

2.  Color difference serve as unusually reliable source of identity

> Color and phenotype are not the only visible cues (posture, bearing,
> gesticulation, clothing and grammatical usage)
>
> So, there is a continuum of cues from visible (birth determined) to no
> visible. (p.46)


Ethnic Groups in Conflict by Horowitz: (originally published in 1985)

Part 2, 47-89. Continuing from Sasha's Summary:

Continuing from *Indicators of Ethnic Identity*

Groups will the mix of cues that they find most reliable. So this will
be different in different contexts.

Because of the difficulting in determining identity, during conflict,
groups will pass as members of attacking or bystanding groups.

In times of peace, members of the superior group will 'forget' the
origin of a successful family from the subordinate group.

*The Concept of an Ethnic Group*

Ethnicity generally is connected to birth and blood. (51-52) Individual
exceptions can be made. But physical anthropologist can determine that
'different' ethnic groups that live in close proximity start becoming
less distinct overtime.

Enid Schildrout's definition: "The minimal definition of an ethnic
unit\...is the idea of common provenance, recruitment primarily through
kinship, and a notion of distinctiveness whether or not this consists of
a unique inventory of cultural traits." (53)

This definition covers: color, language, religious, tribes, races,
nationalities, and castes.

Under this definition "ethnic conflict is one phenomenon and not
several."(53)

### **Chapter 2: A family resemblance**

There are different times of ethnic affiliations. It exists on a
continuum, not a dichotomy

One end is voluntary membership
\<\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\> membership given at birth

*The Kinship with Kinship*

If ethnicity considered kinship, then the premise of a common ancestor
is present. There is an explicit recognition of other members as
family/brotherhood. Often these ethnic groups will describe disputes in
the terms of family quarrels. A continuation of the family metaphor
relates to the concept of being 'first'. The natives are the first-born
of the soil, or the first families. And there should be a deference to
the oldest groups of the society. These are all continuations from the
kinship mindset.

There are more theoretically connections between family and ethnicity.
Ethnicity is sometimes defined by "congeries of family relationships,
and ethnic ties are therefore pyramided on family ties."(59) Small
ethnic groups are an agglomerations of kinship clusters, and larger
castes/regions/dialects are representing the network of extended
families.

Kinship = Ethnicity in certain societies. These societies put a large
emphasis on family, and on family obligations and family networks.
Nepotism is more acceptable, and often expected. Exogamy(intermarriage)
is typically below 10%. Extended kinship is included in most social,
political, and economic transactions.

*Group boundaries and the nature of ethnic affiliations*

Ethnic groups can be more of less inclusive, groups merge with or absorb
others.

Amalgamation and division are opposite processes, as are incorporation
and proliferation.

These group boundaries are neither completely flexible or firm. They
tend to shift in the political contexts. So territorial boundaries come
into play. Ethnicities that have wider territorial boundaries have wider
ethnic boundaries. "Participants in the process of amalgamation had to
adjust their identity upward to conform to the new and larger
environment". (67) The process of forging new identities is based on
perspective. Each environment has specific stimuli, so when the
environment is broaden, all of those stimuli needs to be compared
against each other. In the process of assimilation, those stimuli are
compared against each other and drawn together. Differences that seemed
large in the village are less by comparison in the major urban area.
(68) These differences are based purely on perception, and so there are
examples of ethnic amalgam that have distinct parts. There are no
prerequisites for this process.

*Cultural Movements and Boundary Reinforcement*

A common source of cultural movements are a concern about potential
shift in group boundaries. (70) Something is occurring, either
assimilation or differentiation. So they are either movements of
assimilation or movements of differentiation.

*Movements of Assimilation*

The author gives several examples, all in african nations. In each case
the movement was a reaction to internal differentiation. (71) The
subgroups were drifting apart, and so leaders made an effort to draw
them back together. They standardized the languages, and minimized
cultural differences. They were reacting to colonialism, and as colonial
power waned, there was a fear of subgroup competition.

*Movements of Differentiation*

This is the opposite. Groups fearing assimilation try to resist and hang
on to their differences. "These movements commonly result in an
explosive and violent assertion of group separateness." (72) These
movements are often called cultural revivals, or purity movements.
Typically they challenge languages, religious, cultural symbols. They
can result in separatist movements.

**Culture, Boundaries, and Conflict**

All three of these concepts are constantly interacting. Groups have
specific cultures, they then must live in specific boundaries, and when
those boundaries are challenged, they resolve with conflict.

But some complexity still occurs. All of these concepts are constantly
changing, and reacting to the environment. It is not a one directional
relationship.

**The Utility of Ethnic Affiliations**

It is worth considering the disruptive effect of colonization on these
countries. Often a new state is a combination of many different ethnic
groups, with economic institutions that are designed for colonial
extraction, and a limited concept of citizenship. These colonies were
primarily organized by ethnic groups. Where specific regions or
occupations were done by a specific group. That structure doesn't
function well in international economics. Additionally, in Urban african
cities, new migrants were reliant upon their extended families for any
connection to elites. Ethnic ties are the only way for these societies
to function.

In addition to economic utility, ethnicity also provides social and
political utility. In the social world, ethnic groups build social
capital amongst communities. There is a willingness to cooperate much
better. In politics, ethnic groups are often the 'brand' for political
organizations.

**Ethnic Affiliations and the institutions of the modern state**

The author presents a thought experiment.

Suppose the population of a country is divided into two ethnic groups, A
and B.

A is 60%, B is 40&. The political parties form along ethnic lines. It is
uniform support. Party A will always win in parliament and form the
government. It is really bad to be Group B. They will be forever
excluded from any power. And Group A has no incentive to be nice to
group B. In this scenario it makes perfect sense for group B to resort
to violence.

According to the author, this relationship is a large reason behind the
decline of democracy in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.

One reason why modern liberal states are less successful is due to the
bias against birth. In a liberal framework, birth doesn't matter. States
are composed of individuals, not social groups. And the modern state is
designed on this individualistic assumption. Elections are based on, one
person one vote. There is often a desire to remove ethnicity from
politics. However, that does a bad job of reflecting the power imbalance
on the group. To avoid this, many states make special discriminatory
provisions for one group. (It is unclear to me whether or not the author
thinks this is a good or bad idea)
