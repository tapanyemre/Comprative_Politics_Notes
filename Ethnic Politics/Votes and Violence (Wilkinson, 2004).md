# Long Summary



**Chapter 1: "The electoral incentives for ethnic violence"**

(This is chapter 1 of *[Votes and Violence: Electoral Competition and
Ethnic Riots in India)]{.mark}*

-   **Key idea:**

    -   Ethnic riots are planned by politicians for a clear electoral
        purpose (not spontaneous)

    -   **Why:** "*They are best thought of as a solution to the problem
        of how to change the salience of ethnic issues and identities
        among the electorate in order to build a winning political
        coalition." (1)*

    -   **How:** electoral incentives at two levels (constituency and
        government that controls police) interact to determine both
        where and when ethnic violence against minorities will occur
        and - more importantly - whether the state will choose to
        intervene to stop it (1)

    -   **Data used:** systematic data on [Hindu-Muslim riots in
        India]{.underline}

<!-- -->

-   The authors names three reasons why the author does not like the
    common "instrumental" political explanations for violence
    unsatisfying:

    -   1\) most scholars look at politicians that have incited
        violence, not those that choose to use their capital and prevent
        violence

    -   2\) scholarship fails to account for variations in patterns
        within states (violence is not uniform)

    -   3\) the role of political incentive usually proven just by fact
        that violence has happened and someone gained from it; not
        usually identified independently to exist and to be responsible
        for riots

<!-- -->

-   The author's goal (aka their contribution) is to understand why
    Hindu-Muslim violence takes place in contemporary India

    -   1\) wants to account for interstate and town-level variation in
        ethnic violence

    -   2\) wants to understand the conditions under which politicians
        who control the police and army have an incentive both to foment
        and to prevent ethnic violence

    -   3\) wants to demonstrate that political incentives the author
        identifies as important actually work in the way they suggest
        (using case studies where politicians fomented or restrained
        violence)

<!-- -->

-   **Key argument:**

    -   Town-level electoral incentives account for where Hindu-Muslim
        violence breaks out and state-level electorate incentives
        account for when and where state governments use their police
        force to prevent riots

    -   (controlling for socioeconomic factors, local patterns of ethnic
        diversity, and towns' and states' previous levels of
        Hindu-Muslim conflict → these two electoral levels still remain
        important)

<!-- -->

-   At the local level individuals have many different ethnic and
    nonethnic identities they might identify with politically → a
    politician's goal that the identity that benefits their party best
    remains the most salient one in voters' heads

-   The author suggests that parties that represent elites within a
    ethnic group will use anti-minority events (some sort of
    provocation) are used to stir up some sort of minority
    countermobilization. When these two groups confront each other,
    ethnic violence is a potential outcome.

-   While local electoral incentives are important to determine where
    violence can potentially break out, the likely response of the level
    of government that controls the police and the army determines
    whether a riot is "bloody or ends quickly" (5)

    -   Page 5 gives many examples of ethnic riots in India, US, and
        other states where the level of violence was only possible due
        to inaction on the police/army side

-   The author argues that democratic states will protect minorities
    when it is in their government's electoral interest to do so (6)

*Figure 1 illustrates how governments will determine whether to
intervene or not based on party competition (apparently can be "easily
extended" to other democratic countries)*

**Limitations:**

-   Main limitation in testing theories of ethnic violence is the lack
    of systematic data.

-   The author created with Ashutosh Varshney for India specifically a
    new dataset on Hindu-Muslim violence covering the years 1950-1995
    (town and state level ethnic violence).

-   The author created an additional dataset independently covering the
    years 1900-1949.

    -   Both datasets, information collected from all the newspapers,
        official government reports, archives in India, England and the
        US.

-   Further, gathered town and state-level data in India and Indian
    governments with which to operationalize and test main theories of
    ethnic violence

    -   I.e. to test institutional decay theory (decline in capacity →
        ethnic violence): data collected on politically motivated
        transfer rates, changing ethnic and caste balance of the police
        and administration, and statistics on corruption

    -   I.e. to test economic theories: (focus on town level economic
        competition): census data on employment, case studies, surveys,
        government directories

    -   I.e. to test ecological theories (Hindu-Muslim pop balance or
        presence of Hindu refugees → ethnic violence): census data,
        poverty data, World Bank data)

**Why care about understanding of Hindu-Muslim violence:**

-   Hindu-Muslim riots threaten the stability of the state, economic
    development, fragile relationship with (nuclear-armed) Pakistan
    (even though death rate relatively low (10,000 dead, 30,000 injured
    since 1950)

-   Hindu-Muslim cleavage already exists and has already affected the
    state prior in forced migration of the 1940s

-   Violence between these two groups ricochets beyond state borders
    into other countries (tit-for-tat game)

**Plan for the book:**

-   *Chapter 2*: town-level causes of Hindu-Muslim violence, author
    shows that probability of violence highly related to level of
    electoral competition, author also shows that state-level patterns
    of law enforcement dominate local factors (violence in
    violence-prone areas can be prevented or facilitated in
    no-history-of-violence areas by the police)

-   *Chapter 3 and 4:* explains why certain states have more or less
    violence than others, tests state capacity and governance arguments,
    and tests consociational arguments → neither of those can explain
    variation the author observes in states' levels of Hindu-Muslim
    violence or in their performance in preventing riots (17)

-   *Chapter 5:* tests main argument of book: importance of state-level
    electoral incentives

-   *Chapter 6:* addresses question of what explains states' different
    levels of party competition through three case studies tracing
    history of Hindu-Muslim conflict in states Tamil Nadu, Kerala
    (strong post independence intra-Hindu competition for the Muslim
    vote led to governments serious about stopping and preventing
    Hindu-Muslim violence), and Bahir

-   *Chapter 7:* illustrates generalization potential of the author's
    work to other countries

    -   Selects one case from each of the three waves by Sammy
        Huntington where multiethnic societies moved from non
        competitive party systems to competitive in relatively short
        amount of time (1. Franchise extended to 50% or more adult males
        in many countries in Europe, Americas, Australia, NZ from
        1828-1926, 2. After WW2 former colonies and Latin American
        countries become democratic, 3. Portuguese Revolution in 1974,
        liberalization of Eastern European countries, etc.)

        -   Argues that patterns of ethnic violence are consistent

            -   Where political competition fiercest, that's where
                ethnic riots took place

            -   State's reaction was determined by its support base and
                overall degree of party competition

        -   *Larger question of the book: does democratic competition
            inflames or reduces ethnic violence?*

-   *Chapter 8:* the author argues that even though competition can
    foment violence, there are many ways in which political competition
    as well as cleavage structures can be altered so that politicians
    have incentives to be moderate toward minorities (18)
