# Long Summary


Sambanis, Nicholas, and Moses Shayo. 2013. "Social Identification and
Ethnic Conflict." *American Political Science Review 107* (*2*):294-325

*Most of this is directly from the text*

The model within this work highlights the possibility of vicious and
virtuous cycles where conflict and identification patterns reinforce
each other. It also shows how processes of ethnic identification amplify
the importance of political institutions and traces the effects of
national status and perceived differences across ethnic groups. Finally,
the authors demonstrate how a small but sufficiently potent group of
ethnic radicals can derail a peaceful equilibrium, leading to the
polarization of the entire population. They reexamine several historical
cases as well as empirical correlates of civil wars in light of these
results. -- from the abstract

**Key Takeaways:**

-   ï»¿Ethnic conflicts account for 50-70% of civil wars in the post 1945
    period

-   Per capita income, terrain, resource dependence, ethnic structure,
    regime type can explain little of the variation in the intensity of
    ethnic conflict

-   Ethnic cleavages do not always increase the risk of violent
    political conflict

-   The crucial feature of the model is that while patterns of social
    identification shape conflict risk, conflict also shapes patters of
    social identification

-   Individuals care about their group even absent any strategic
    considerations

-   An individual's social identity affects his decision on how much
    effort or researouce to contribute to fighting

-   Ethnic identification tends to increase fighting while national
    identification tends to reduce it

-   Ethnic conflict tends to make ethnic differences more prominent

-   Identity can be very malleable, shaped by events and institutions.
    And yet, identity is often very durable, creating lasting
    attachments and strongly affecting individual behavior.

-   Does not assume that individuals automatically identify with any
    group they belong to and seek to endogenize this process

-   Across many countries, minorities tend to identify less with the
    nation than do majorities

-   Individuals want to identify with high-status groups

-   Emphasizes psychological explanation for ethnic conflict

-   Multiple equilibria in a conflict and identification patterns

-   Nation building (both by advancing national status and by
    cultivating common attributes) is important for avoiding internal
    conflict

-   Identification processes can significantly amplify the importance of
    effective institutions that limit the size of national resources
    which can be captured to benefit one group over another.

-   Even absent incomplete information or sophisticated leaders, small
    groups of radicals can pull moderates into the fray if these groups
    are not well integrated and have sufficient resources.

-   Authors show that the deeper source of conflict is the way in which
    the prescens of resources affects ethnic identification

-   This model predicts that intense ethnic conflict makes people care
    more about their ethnic group relative to other groups, and seek to
    resemble it more.
